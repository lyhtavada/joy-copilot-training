# Redeeming Rewards — Frequently Asked Questions

Q1: How do I redeem a reward?

A1: Open the Rewards tab, select the reward you want, and tap "Redeem". Follow the redemption flow — you may receive a voucher code, barcode, or an automatic discount applied at checkout.

Q2: What are the point requirements to redeem?

A2: Each reward lists its required point cost. Basic vouchers often have low thresholds; premium rewards require higher point balances.

Q3: I redeemed but didn't receive a voucher — what now?

A3: Check your in-app inbox and notifications. If the voucher is missing, confirm your points were deducted. If not present, retry or contact Support with the redemption timestamp and screenshots.

Q4: Are vouchers single-use?

A4: Most digital vouchers are single-use and tied to your account. Terms on the reward detail page will specify single-use or reusability.

Q5: How long until I receive a physical reward shipment?

A5: Physical rewards list estimated processing and shipping times in the reward terms. If shipment is delayed beyond the stated window, contact Support with your order reference.
