# Handling blank screen issue after app update

Owner: Lan Anh Bùi
Created time: August 15, 2024 10:22 AM

## Context

When our app releases an update that introduces new features, it often requires additional permissions from Shopify to function correctly. Users need to update their data access permissions to continue using the app.

<aside>
🚫 Never ask customers to uninstall the app and then reinstall it as doing so will result in the cancellation of their subscriptions.

## Issue

Due to an unclear issue from Shopify's end, the update message may not be displayed immediately. Instead, users encounter a blank screen, preventing access to the app's features.

## How to resolve: CS update the app

Hello there,

Thank you for reaching out and bringing this issue to our attention. 

We recently released new features that require additional permissions to function 
correctly. Occasionally, due to an unclear issue from Shopify's end, the message to 
update these permissions does not display immediately, resulting in a blank screen.

To resolve this, please clear your browser cache or reload the app page a few times 
until you see the update message as in this screenshot (https://avada-image.pages.dev/i/lnpqppIls). 
You might need to open the app from Shopify admin > Settings > Apps and sales channels 
(https://avada-image.pages.dev/i/0KXT2mPfk). The app should be accessible once it’s 
updated. Here's a tutorial for your reference: https://www.loom.com/share/f53803ea204640c2b7e39dea8e60bf36?sid=abde16b3-1380-4721-9679-e4ca83b53d88

If the above solutions do not resolve the issue, we would like to request access to the 
store so we can update the app for you. If you are comfortable with this option, please 
share the collaborator code with us so that we can send an access request.

Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused you, and we 
appreciate your patience and cooperation as we work to resolve it. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to let us know.

Best regards,
Avada Support

⚠️ CS should ask for **Full permission**, update the app then remove the access to ensure the store’s security.

### Additional Information

- Ensure that customers understand this is a known issue with Shopify and that it might take a few attempts to resolve.
- Emphasize the importance of updating permissions to use the new features fully and ensure optimal app functionality. This is a standard process when apps evolve to offer more capabilities.
- **Even if they cannot access the app, the app’s features still continue to work.**
