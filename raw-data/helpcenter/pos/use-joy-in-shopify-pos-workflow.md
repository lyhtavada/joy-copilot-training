### [hashtag](#introduction) Introduction

Integrating our Joy loyalty program into your POS system allows cashiers to easily manage both the earning and redeeming of points right at the checkout. This not only makes transactions smoother but also enhances the overall shopping experience by leveraging membership benefits directly in-store. This guide will demonstrate the essential steps for cashiers to effectively operate the Joy system at your POS.

First, make sure you have installed Joy Loyalty on your POS device. If you haven't installed it yet, please refer to [the instructions herearrow-up-right](https://help.joy.so/pos/add-joy-to-shopify-pos).

In order to use the Joy extension, the cart cannot be empty. The cart should have the customer and products added already. Also, the customer needs to be a member already to have a balance available for redeeming for coupons.

If it is for earning points, then you just need to process the order normally, and the customer will receive the points for their orders.

To interact with the POS UI on the grid, make sure the shopping cart **is not empty** and includes both customer and product information.

First, the cashier should ask the customer for their email or phone number to check if they already exist in the Shopify database. If found, the customer can be directly assigned to the cart. If they’re new, create a new customer profile with their personal information—this helps them enjoy a smooth loyalty experience across both online and offline channels.

If you create a customer on POS without identifying them beforehand, it would create duplicate customers on Shopify, which later on makes the loyalty program harder to work for them.

For earning points, simply process the order as usual; registered customers will automatically gain points for their purchases, just as they do on the online store. The only difference in the process is that the POS purchases are often paid and fulfilled on the fly.

### [hashtag](#wrap-up) Wrap up

Integrating Joy Loyalty with your POS simplifies loyalty rewards at checkout, allowing customers to easily earn and redeem points. Ensure the cart includes customer and product details for redemption, while earning points happens automatically with standard order processing. These instructions apply to Shopify POS; for other systems, please contact us for support. With Joy, you can streamline checkout and strengthen customer loyalty effortlessly.
