### [hashtag](#introduction) Introduction

Shopify POS allows for seamless integration of applications directly into the POS grid through extensions. This capability enhances the functionality at the point of sale, making transactions smoother for both retailers and customers.

With our Joy app, you can easily add this functionality to your Shopify POS grid, streamlining operations and improving the customer experience.

Customers can choose between two versions of the Joy widget for Shopify POS: Joy Loyalty POS Extension and Joy: Loyalty program (Legacy).

1. **New Version (Joy Loyalty POS Extension)**: Launched in 2024, leveraging the [Shopify POS UI extensionarrow-up-right](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/pos-ui-extensions), this version enhances the POS interface with features like a modal for customer redemptions, inputs for greater flexibility, and the ability to see the member's status and name. It allows customers to redeem free products, locate existing coupons, and manage their loyalty details more effectively.

1. **Previous Version (Joy: Loyalty Program)**: This legacy version is now deprecated. Initially, it displayed the balance and basic member information directly in the grid and allowed for redeeming discounts and percentages with fixed presets. Due to advancements in technology and customer feedback, we recommend migrating to the latest version for improved functionality and support.

### [hashtag](#faqs) Enable your POS programs

By default, the programs set up in your store are not automatically enabled for the POS channel. To ensure that your customers can earn and redeem points at the point of sale, you must actively select which earning and redeeming programs should be available on POS channels.

#### [hashtag](#i-add-a-customer-in-pos-but-it-still-says-no-program-available-what-is-the-error-and-what-should-i-d) I added a customer in POS but it still says no program available. What is the error and what should I do?[​arrow-up-right](https://help.avada.app/joy/how-to-set-up-joy-in-pos/#i-add-a-customer-in-pos-but-it-still-says-no-program-available-what-is-the-error-and-what-should-i-do)

This is a common question we receive from our customers. If you encounter this error, make sure that:

- You have subscribed to our Pro plan as POS integration is only available within this plan. If you are using the Joy Free plan, points will show as zero on POS.
- The customer has enough points to redeem and use the reward
- You have set up and enabled at least **one redeem program** for POS.
- You have successfully connected Joy to the POS system.
- Before being able to select any available program in Joy, you must first select the product and customer and ensure the Joy app is connected.
