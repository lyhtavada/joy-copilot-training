In order to set up a special earning rate on BCFM, Chrismas, you need to be on the Advanced plan with Rule engine mode turned on. With the Rule engine, you are no longer limited to one Place Order program; now, you can create many Place Order programs with different rates, valid times, and priorities.

Make sure that you tick the "Stop further rules processing" for the special occasion program. And then, configure the Reward rule to match your desire: different rate by tier or not, point earning rate.
