## [hashtag](#changelog) Changelog

Joy loyalty program changelog for merchants who want a regularly updated product. We think that constant development and improvement is the way to achieve an excellent result.

### [hashtag](#id-1.193-2026-02) [1.193] - 2026-02

#### [hashtag](#new-pricing) New pricing

Updated subscription pricing for new customers effective February 2026, with grandfathered rate protection for existing subscribers.

[View guide](/product-roadmap/changelog/pricing-update-for-new-customers-02-2026)

#### [hashtag](#subscription-milestones) Subscription Milestones

Added subscription milestone type to reward customers for consecutive billing cycles, expanding milestone capabilities beyond transactional actions.

### [hashtag](#id-1.192-2026-01) [1.192] - 2026-01

#### [hashtag](#instagram-comment-rewards) Instagram Comment Rewards

Merchants in fashion and lifestyle need organic social engagement to boost brand awareness. Running ads is expensive with diminishing returns. Now customers can earn points by commenting on Instagram posts - creating natural interaction that helps posts go viral. Includes keyword filtering to reward specific answers or avoid spam, plus auto-reply and DM notifications to acknowledge engagement.

#### [hashtag](#membership-subscription-via-joy-subscription-native-integration) Membership Subscription via Joy Subscription (Native Integration)

Setting up membership previously required complex Shopify Flow configuration with poor UX. Native integration with Joy Subscription enables "plug-and-play" setup, increasing cross-app adoption within the Avada ecosystem. Customers who purchase subscription plans automatically enter VIP tiers and receive benefits, building a tighter recurring revenue and loyalty loop. Two-way sync between apps.[[1]arrow-up-right](https://avadaio.slack.com/archives/C07RNAY9ZC6/p1770001420653769)

#### [hashtag](#loyalty-note) Loyalty Note

Ideas pop up while setting up programs - a campaign to launch, a widget tweak to make. Instead of switching to external tools, merchants now have a built-in notebook with rich text and todo lists right inside Joy.

#### [hashtag](#submit-receipt-program) Submit Receipt Program

Not all purchases happen online. Customers shopping at physical locations or partner stores can now submit receipts to earn points, helping merchants reward and convert offline customers into loyal program members.

[View guidearrow-up-right](https://help.joy.so/reward-programs/earning-programs/submit-receipt)

#### [hashtag](#submit-form-program) Submit Form Program

Merchants want to reward custom actions (like Facebook shares, offline check-ins, user-generated content) that APIs typically can't capture. This program allows customers to submit proof (links/images) for manual merchant approval, covering those niche use cases.[[1]arrow-up-right](https://avadaio.slack.com/archives/C07RNAY9ZC6/p1770001420653769)

#### [hashtag](#store-credit-rewards-in-all-milestones) Store Credit Rewards in All Milestones

Many merchants need cashback-style rewards (real money) in wallets instead of traditional discount coupons. Store credit has higher real-world value (accumulates, direct payment), helping increase the perceived value of rewards. Now available for all milestone programs, not just place order. Credits are added directly to customer balance

#### [hashtag](#other-improvements) Other Improvements

- **Place order program** now supports store credit rewards as a direct cashback alternative to points
- **Widget popup behavior** is now configurable after customers close it, preventing unwanted repeat appearances
- **Instagram Shopify Flow trigger**: Added "Customer comment on Instagram" trigger for workflow automation
- **Analytics enhancement**: New "New member" chart in Member Analytics v2 for tracking member growth trends
- **Store credit translations**: Full storefront translation support for store credit features
- **Language support**: Added Kurdish (Sorani) language option
- **VIP tier notifications**: Added editable message field for "achieved highest tier" notification customization
- **Performance optimization**: Improved monthly customer export for stores with large datasets
- Multiple bug fixes including refund point flow, pending points logic, minimum quantity conditions for shipping rewards, POS guest customer point balance reset, and birthday reward display issues

### [hashtag](#id-1.191-2025-12) [1.191] - 2025-12

#### [hashtag](#fifo-point-expiration) FIFO Point Expiration

Traditional expiration rules wipe all points at once - frustrating for customers who just earned new points. FIFO (First In, First Out) expires points in the order they were earned, so recent activity is always protected. Available on Advanced plan and above.

#### [hashtag](#milestone-rewards-customers-choice) Milestone Rewards - Customer’s Choice

Auto-granted rewards can feel invisible. Now customers can pick their own reward when reaching milestones, creating memorable moments that strengthen emotional connection to the program.

#### [hashtag](#store-credit-referrals) Store Credit Referrals

Fixed point rewards don’t reflect the value a referrer brings. The new percentage-based store credit option means bigger referral orders earn bigger rewards - real cashback that motivates customers to refer high-value friends.

#### [hashtag](#flexible-free-shipping) Flexible Free Shipping

Free shipping doesn’t always mean 100% off. Merchants can now offer partial shipping discounts (50% off, $10 off) to balance customer value with shipping costs across different tiers and segments.

#### [hashtag](#other-improvements-1) Other Improvements

- Redeeming programs can target specific Shopify customer segments
- VIP tier entry rewards can be disabled when customers regain a tier after downgrade
- New “Point balance” widget style for minimalist storefronts
- Redemption limits for seasonal or one-time programs (e.g., Christmas gifts)
- “Exclude specific collections” saves time vs selecting hundreds of eligible collections
- Member exclusive deals can be restricted to POS only or Online store only

- “Reach new milestone” email notification keeps customers engaged
- Free gift program supports multiple quantities per product
- Referral program can require login to prevent abuse
- Starter plan shows usage fee progress on homepage
- Warning banner appears when Shopify Flow integration is missing

### [hashtag](#id-1.190-2025-11) [1.190] - 2025-11

#### [hashtag](#new-onboarding-experience) New Onboarding Experience

The old onboarding was walls of text with blurry images. The new flow is interactive - merchants set up their program while learning, with clear progress and modern UI that matches the quality of Advanced and Ultimate plans.

#### [hashtag](#customer-self-revoke-coupons) Customer Self-Revoke Coupons

Mistakes happen. Customers who redeem by accident or change their mind can now revoke their own coupons and get points back instantly, reducing support tickets and improving flexibility.

#### [hashtag](#point-to-currency-conversion) Point-to-Currency Conversion

Points represent real business value. Merchants can now set an exchange rate to see point balances as currency, making financial planning and ROI tracking straightforward.

#### [hashtag](#joy-wishlist-launch) Joy Wishlist Launch

Joy Wishlist launches as a standalone app, designed to integrate deeply with Joy Loyalty. Wishlists drive purchase intent; loyalty drives repeat purchases - together they create a powerful retention engine.

[View apparrow-up-right](https://apps.shopify.com/joy-wishlist?search_id=b5daca6b-0177-438a-9a17-76cea5c06c4d&surface_detail=wishlist&surface_inter_position=2&surface_intra_position=8&surface_type=search)

### [hashtag](#id-1.189-2025-10) [1.189] - 2025-10

#### [hashtag](#apple-wallet-and-widget-qr-codes) Apple Wallet & Widget QR Codes

Google Wallet support was popular, but many customers use iPhone. Apple Wallet loyalty passes are now available - customers add their QR code once and scan at POS without opening their phone. The QR code also appears directly in the widget for quick access.

[View guide](/customers/generate-customer-qr-code/apple-wallet-loyalty-pass)

#### [hashtag](#manual-customer-enrollment) Manual Customer Enrollment

Some merchants need customers to accept terms before joining, or want to manually approve members. The new “Manually assigned customers only” option disables auto-enrollment - customers join only through Flow actions, admin approval, or explicit opt-in.

[View guide](/settings/general/manually-select-who-can-join-loyalty-program)

#### [hashtag](#custom-program-triggers) Custom Program Triggers

The old custom program only supported “Visit a page.” Now merchants can trigger rewards from any website event - button clicks, form submissions, completed activities - or through Shopify Flow for maximum flexibility. Available on Advanced plan and above.

[View guide](/reward-programs/earning-programs/custom-program)

#### [hashtag](#referral-at-checkout) Referral at Checkout

The traditional referral flow has too many steps: copy link, enter email, receive code, shop, checkout, apply code. Now referrals can happen right at checkout, dramatically improving conversion.

#### [hashtag](#payment-method-rewards) Payment Method Rewards

Merchants partnering with payment providers (Visa, Mastercard, Atome, Krispay) can now reward customers for using specific payment methods, enabling co-marketing opportunities and payment partner incentives.

#### [hashtag](#other-improvements-3) Other Improvements

- Shopify Flow action to exclude customers from loyalty program
- Each program can have its own description instead of sharing one translation
- New Klaviyo triggers for more sophisticated email automation

### [hashtag](#id-1.187-2025-08) [1.187] - 2025-08

#### [hashtag](#shopify-admin-integration) Shopify Admin Integration

Merchants live in Shopify Admin. A new Joy Loyalty block in the customer detail page shows loyalty info at a glance - points, tier, activity - without switching apps. Pin the block once and it appears for all customers.

#### [hashtag](#day-of-week-promotions) Day-of-Week Promotions

Weekend shoppers behave differently than weekday browsers. Place order programs can now target specific days - double points on slow Tuesdays, bonus rewards for weekend purchases.

#### [hashtag](#smart-apply-now-button) Smart “Apply Now” Button

When a coupon’s product is already in the cart, “Add to cart” creates duplicates. The new “Apply now” button detects this and navigates directly to checkout with the discount applied.

#### [hashtag](#other-improvements-4) Other Improvements

- Duplicate any earning or redeeming program with one click
- Sandbox mode shows expected launch date banner to help support teams assist merchants
