### [hashtag](#understanding-grandfathered-pricing) Understanding grandfathered pricing

circle-check

**Grandfathered pricing** means your subscription rate stays locked at the price you originally signed up for, regardless of future pricing updates.

#### [hashtag](#how-it-works) How it works

If you subscribed to Joy Loyalty **before February 9****th** **2026**, you belong to one of two cohorts with special pricing protection:

**Cohort 1: Subscribed before September 2025 (Oldest cohort)**

**Your protection:**

- ✅ Keep your rate permanently — even if you downgrade to Free plan
- ✅ Upgrade to higher plans at legacy rates
- ❌ Lose protection **only if you uninstall** the app

> **Example:** You started on Essential at $24.90/month. You can upgrade to Advanced ($99, not $129) or downgrade to Free and come back to Essential at $24.90 anytime — as long as you don't uninstall.

**Cohort 2: Subscribed between September 2025 - February 8****th** **2026 (Middle cohort)**

**Your protection:**

- ✅ Keep your rate as long as you stay on or above your **starting plan**

circle-info

#### [hashtag](#what-is-the-starting-plan) What is the starting plan?

The starting plan is the very first plan you are on, right after this new pricing takes effect.

- ✅ Upgrade to higher plans at legacy rates
- ⚠️ Lose protection if you downgrade **below your starting plan**
- ❌ Lose protection if you uninstall the app

> **Example:** You started on Advanced at $99/month. You can upgrade to Ultimate ($499) or stay on Advanced at $99. But if you downgrade to Essential, you lose protection and pay $29/month (the new rate).

### [hashtag](#special-cases) Special cases

#### [hashtag](#opening-additional-stores) Opening additional stores

If you're an early supporter and open a new store:

**What happens:**

- Your new store initially shows current (new) pricing
- You can request legacy pricing to be applied manually

**How to get legacy pricing on new stores:**

1. Install Joy Loyalty on your new store
2. Contact Joy support via in-app chat or [[email protected]envelope](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#23505653534c51576342554247420d4a4c)
3. Provide:

   - Your original store URL (with grandfathered pricing)
   - Your new store URL
4. Our team will manually review your business to apply the legacy rate to the new store

This courtesy is **only available** to merchants who subscribed before the February 9th 2026 pricing update.

#### [hashtag](#uninstalling-and-reinstalling) Uninstalling and reinstalling

triangle-exclamation

**CRITICAL:** Uninstalling Joy Loyalty **permanently ends your grandfathered pricing** — regardless of your cohort.

**What happens when you uninstall:**

- Your grandfathered pricing status is immediately removed
- All subscription history is retained (customer data, points, etc.)
- If you reinstall later, current pricing applies
- **The legacy rate cannot be restored** after uninstall

**Before you uninstall, consider:**

- Downgrading to the Free plan instead (keeps your data and grandfathered status for Cohort 1)
- Contacting support to discuss alternatives
- Understanding that once you uninstall, your special rate is gone forever

### [hashtag](#frequently-asked-questions) Frequently asked questions

#### [hashtag](#general-questions) General Questions

**Will my price increase automatically?**
No. If you're already subscribed before **February 9****th** **2026**, your rate stays the same unless you downgrade below your starting plan (Cohort 2 only) or uninstall the app.

**How do I know if I have grandfathered pricing?**
Go to Settings → Subscription. If you see $24.90 for Essential or $99 for Advanced, you have grandfathered pricing.

**Can new subscribers get the old pricing?**
No. Grandfathered pricing is only available to merchants who subscribed before the pricing update in **February 9****th** **2026**.

#### [hashtag](#upgrade-questions) Upgrade Questions

**I just upgraded but see a higher price than expected. Why?**
If you're an early supporter with grandfathered pricing, you should see the legacy rate. This may be a display error. Contact support immediately — they'll verify your cohort and correct the billing if needed.

**If I upgrade, can I downgrade back to my original plan?**
Yes. And whether you keep grandfathered pricing depends on your cohort:

- **Cohort 1:** Always keep protection when downgrading
- **Cohort 2:** Keep protection only if downgrading to/above your starting plan

#### [hashtag](#downgrade-questions) Downgrade Questions

**What is my "starting plan"?**
Your starting plan is the first paid plan you subscribe to with Joy Loyalty right when this new pricing takes effect. If you started on Essential and later upgraded to Advanced, your starting plan is still Essential.

**Can I switch back to my old plan after downgrading?**
Yes, you can upgrade again anytime. However:

- If you already lost grandfathered pricing by downgrading below your starting plan, you'll pay the new rates for all plans
- If you kept grandfathered pricing (Cohort 1), you'll get the legacy rate when upgrading again

#### [hashtag](#special-situations) Special Situations

**I temporarily paused my subscription. Do I keep my special rate?**
Joy doesn't have a pause feature, but if you downgraded to Free:

- **Cohort 1:** You keep your protection and can return to your legacy rate
- **Cohort 2:** Depends on whether Free was your starting plan

**What if I can't afford the new rates after losing grandfathered pricing?**
Before making changes that would lose your special rate, contact support to discuss your situation. There may be alternative solutions or special circumstances we can accommodate.

**Will there be future price increases?**
Joy may adjust pricing in the future to reflect ongoing product improvements. If that happens, existing subscribers at the time of the increase would be grandfathered at their current rates, following the same protection policy.

#### [hashtag](#multi-store-questions) Multi-Store Questions

**I have multiple stores. Do they all get grandfathered pricing?**
Only stores that installed Joy Loyalty before February 2026 automatically receive grandfathered pricing. For new stores opened after the pricing change, you'll need to contact support to request legacy pricing (see "Opening additional stores" section above).

**If one of my stores loses grandfathered pricing, does it affect my other stores?**
No. Each store's pricing status is independent. Losing grandfathered pricing on one store doesn't affect your other stores.
