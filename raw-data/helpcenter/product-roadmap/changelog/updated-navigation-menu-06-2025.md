### [hashtag](#what-is-this-update) What is this update

The updated navigation menu is a streamlined interface that consolidates Joy's features into 7 main menu items instead of the previous expanded structure. This reorganization improves user experience by reducing menu clutter and grouping related functionalities together in logical sections.

The new menu structure eliminates the need for a "see more" option by strategically moving certain features into more appropriate parent sections. This change makes it easier for merchants to find the tools they need while maintaining quick access to all Joy features.
