### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

**Q: Will customers receive the points immediately when they place an order?** A: No, customers will only see that they have earned points pending fulfillment. The actual points are awarded according to your existing order status rules (typically when marked as "fulfilled").

**Q: What happens if an order is cancelled or refunded?** A: The pending activity log will be updated to reflect the cancellation or refund, and no points will be awarded. If points were already awarded, they will be deducted according to your refund settings.

**Q: Can customers redeem pending points?** A: No, pending points cannot be redeemed until the order is actually fulfilled and the points are officially awarded to the customer's account.

**Q: Does this feature work with all order statuses?** A: This feature specifically works with the "fulfilled" order status setting. The activity log is created immediately upon order placement, but points are still awarded based on your configured order status rules.

**Q: Will this feature affect my existing point earning rules?** A: No, this feature only adds visibility to the point earning process. Your existing rules for when points are actually awarded remain unchanged.

**Q: What if I have complex earning rules with different point values?** A: The system will calculate and display the expected points based on all your current earning rules, including product-specific multipliers, customer tier bonuses, and promotional campaigns.
