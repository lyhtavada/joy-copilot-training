### [hashtag](#what-is-this-feature) What is this feature

The Joy Loyalty button color customization feature allows you to set global color variables for all buttons across your loyalty page. Instead of having to edit button colors individually in each section, you can now set primary, secondary, and disabled button colors in one central location. These color settings automatically apply to all buttons throughout your loyalty program, ensuring visual consistency and brand alignment.

### [hashtag](#why-use-this-feature) Why use this feature

Consistent button colors across your loyalty program create a more professional, cohesive customer experience. By maintaining your brand identity throughout the customer journey, you establish stronger recognition and trust with your audience. This feature saves you valuable time by allowing you to update all button colors in one central location instead of tediously modifying each section individually. With global button color settings, you can ensure your loyalty program feels like an integrated extension of your brand rather than a disconnected third-party element.
