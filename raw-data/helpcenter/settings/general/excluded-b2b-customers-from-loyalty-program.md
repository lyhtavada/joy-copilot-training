### [hashtag](#what-is-this-feature) What is this feature

The B2B customer exclusion feature in Joy Loyalty automatically prevents customers marked as B2B in Shopify from participating in your loyalty program. When a customer is designated as a B2B customer through Shopify's company management, Joy Loyalty will prevent them from:

- check

  Joining your loyalty program
- check

  Earning points on purchases
- check

  Redeeming points for rewards
- check

  Accessing tier-based privileges (if you have VIP tiers enabled)

This ensures your loyalty program remains focused on retail customers while maintaining separate pricing and discount structures for your business customers.

### [hashtag](#requirements-before-using-this-feature) Requirements before using this feature

To use the B2B exclusion feature, you need:

1. A Shopify Plus store subscription
2. The Joy Loyalty app installed
3. At least one B2B customer assigned to a company in your Shopify admin

### [hashtag](#why-use-this-feature) Why use this feature

B2B customers typically receive special pricing, bulk discounts, or customized contractual terms. Including these customers in your loyalty program could potentially:

- Allow B2B customers to stack loyalty discounts on top of negotiated B2B pricing
- Create pricing inconsistencies in your business model
- Impact your store's revenue and profit margins
- Create confusion between B2B and DTC purchasing processes

By excluding B2B customers, you maintain clear separation between your loyalty program for individual shoppers and your business customer relationships.

### [hashtag](#setting-up-b2b-customer-exclusion) Setting up B2B customer exclusion

Configuring this feature requires setting your customer eligibility preferences and optionally syncing customer data to ensure all B2B designations are current.

1

**Choose your customer eligibility setting**

- From your Shopify admin, navigate to **Apps** > **Joy Loyalty**
- In the left sidebar, click on **Settings**
- Select the **General** tab
- Find the **Customer Eligibility** section
- You'll see two options:

  - **All customers**: Both direct-to-consumer (DTC) and business-to-business (B2B) customers will be eligible for the loyalty program
  - **Only DTC customers**: Exclude B2B customers from the loyalty program. Only direct-to-consumer customers will earn and redeem points
- Select **Only DTC customers** to activate the B2B exclusion feature
- Click **Save changes**

**Sync customer B2B status**

To ensure Joy Loyalty has the most current information about which customers are part of B2B companies:

1. In the **Customer Eligibility** section, look for the **Sync customer data** area
2. Click **Sync now** to update the B2B status and company information for all customers
3. The system will display when the last sync occurred and how many customers were updated

Once synced, any customer associated with a company in Shopify will be automatically excluded from your loyalty program.

### [hashtag](#frequently-asked-questions) Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will enabling this feature affect my existing DTC customers?**
A: No, enabling B2B customer exclusion will only impact customers who are assigned to a company in Shopify. All your direct-to-consumer customers will continue to participate in your loyalty program as usual.

**Q: What happens if a customer was in my loyalty program and then gets added to a B2B company?**
A: Once a customer is added to a B2B company and you've selected "Only DTC customers," they will no longer be able to earn or redeem points. Their loyalty status will be suspended as long as they remain a B2B customer.

**Q: Can a B2B customer still see previous orders they placed as an individual?**
A: According to Shopify's B2B functionality, after a customer is added to a company, they can no longer view their previous individual orders on your website.

**Q: Will this feature impact my draft orders?**
A: When you create draft orders for B2B customers, these orders will not earn loyalty points once the feature is enabled.

**Q: How often should I sync B2B customer data?**
A: The system will sync periodically, but we recommend manually syncing after making significant changes to your B2B customer assignments in Shopify.
