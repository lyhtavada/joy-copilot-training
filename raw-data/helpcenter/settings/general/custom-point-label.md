### [hashtag](#what-is-the-custom-point-label-feature) What is the Custom point label feature

The Custom Point Label feature allows you to replace the standard "point" and "points" terminology with custom words that better align with your brand identity and business theme. For example, a cosmetics store might use "Glam" and "Glams" instead of "point" and "points," while a bookstore might use "Page" and "Pages."

This feature also lets you control whether the label appears before or after the numerical value, giving you complete flexibility over how point values are displayed throughout your loyalty program.

### [hashtag](#why-you-should-use-custom-point-labels) Why you should use Custom point labels

Personalizing your loyalty program's terminology creates a more cohesive and immersive brand experience. When your loyalty currency uses language that reflects your brand identity, several benefits emerge:

Custom point labels strengthen your brand identity by extending your unique voice to every aspect of the customer experience. When customers earn "Stars" at a coffee shop or "Sparkles" at a jewelry store, they're engaging with a currency that feels special and exclusive to your business, not just generic "points."

This personalization makes your loyalty program more memorable and distinctive, helping it stand out from competitors. Customers are more likely to engage with and remember a program that feels tailored specifically to your brand, rather than a generic template that could belong to any business.

Keep it simple

Consider international customers

Test with customers

Choose words that are:

- Short (ideally one or two syllables)
- Easy to understand
- Easy to remember
- Simple to pronounce

If you serve an international audience, make sure your chosen terms:

- Don't have negative connotations in other languages
- Are relatively easy for non-native speakers to understand
- Don't rely on cultural references that might be unfamiliar

Before finalizing, consider:

- Asking loyal customers for feedback on your new point terminology
- Testing different options to see which resonates best
- Ensuring the term works well in all contexts (earning, spending, displaying balances)
