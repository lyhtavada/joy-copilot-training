This feature is available for **All** plans.

### [hashtag](#overview) Overview

A loyalty program is never “set and forget.” Even when your earning rules, VIP tiers, and rewards are already in place, customers will still need attention — missing points, checkout as guests, lost coupons, unclear tier progress, or sync issues with Shopify and marketing tools.

These moments happen often, and when they do, the **Customer Management** page becomes the place you rely on the most. This is where you understand what happened with a specific customer and take the right action to support them.

Because of that, we focus on helping you navigate this page well. Customer Management is the hub where you handle almost everything after your loyalty program goes live — the real, ongoing work of keeping data correct and supporting your members.

We constantly update this page to make sure that what you need to find, is there.

### [hashtag](#why-we-highlight-this-page) Why we highlight this page

After setup, the loyalty program continues through your customers’ real behavior: placing orders, making returns, redeeming rewards, creating coupons, referring friends, or unsubscribing from emails. Most questions or issues merchants face come from these everyday actions.

Customer Management gives you a complete view of each customer. It helps you check whether everything is properly synced, whether their points were calculated correctly, and whether referrals or rewards happened as expected. It’s where you get clarity before making any changes.

### [hashtag](#how-to-set-up-and-use-customer-management) How to set up and use Customer Management

#### [hashtag](#access-customer-management) **Access Customer Management**

Open **Joy → Customers** from your Shopify admin sidebar.
This brings you to the customer grid — the overview of all customers who have interacted with your loyalty program.

#### [hashtag](#on-customer-grid) **On customer grid**

The customer grid gives you a fast, high-level understanding of your loyalty audience. Instead of opening each customer profile, you can quickly assess their current loyalty status from here. It is especially useful for support conversations, audits, or when you want to review VIP tiers or point balances at scale.

The grid displays:

- **Customer name and email** – their identity
- **Membership type** – Member, Guest, or Left
- **Points** – current active balance
- **VIP tier** – the tier they belong to
- **VIP point** – amount that contributed toward their tier, can be point amount or spent amount.
- **Birthday -** Customer birthday
- **Last updated** – the last time loyalty data was synced

You can search by name or email, filter by segments or tiers, and quickly click into any customer profile for deeper investigation.

#### [hashtag](#open-an-individual-customer-profile) **Open an individual customer profile**

Click on any customer in the grid to open their full loyalty profile.
This is where you can review their entire journey, correct mistakes, manage points, and ensure all data is synced properly across Shopify and your integrations.

### [hashtag](#understanding-the-customer-profile) Understanding the customer profile

#### [hashtag](#overview-1) **Overview**

This section gives you a quick snapshot of the customer so you can understand their situation before making any changes. You’ll see:

- **Personal information** — Name, email, phone, birthday.
- **Membership status** — Whether they’re a member or guest.
- **Shopify account details** — Account created or not, email verified or not.
- **Marketing sync** — Klaviyo and Omnisend subscription status.
- **Notification preference** — Whether they receive reward notifications.
- **VIP tier & progress** — Current tier, VIP spend, and next threshold.
- **Order summary** — Total orders and lifetime value.
- **Referral link & stats** — Their link, pending referrals, completed referrals.
- **Balance** — Active points, points earned, points redeemed, adjustments, and expirations.

These details help you quickly understand the customer’s profile and diagnose most loyalty-related issues.

#### [hashtag](#coupon-history) **Coupon history**

This list shows every coupon the customer has created with their points. You can review the coupon code, value, point cost, creation date, and status, and you can revoke unused coupons if needed. It’s useful when checking past redemptions or repairing issues with old or lost codes.

#### [hashtag](#referrals-and-referral-activity) **Referrals & referral activity**

This area displays the customer’s referral link and a summary of their referral activity, including pending referrals, completed referrals, and their overall conversion rate. It gives you a quick sense of whether their referrals were tracked and credited properly.

#### [hashtag](#activity-history-full-timeline) **Activity history (full timeline)**

This is the full timeline of the customer’s loyalty activity — orders, earned points, tier upgrades, manual adjustments, redemptions, expirations, and referral events. When a customer asks “Why did I receive these points?” or “Why didn’t I level up?”, this timeline gives you the exact answer.

#### [hashtag](#integration-sync-status-shopify-klaviyo-omnisend) **Integration sync status (Shopify, Klaviyo, Omnisend)**

This section shows whether the customer is fully synced across your connected platforms. You can open their Shopify profile directly using the Shopify view link, check whether their Shopify account exists and is email-verified, and see if the customer was successfully synced to Klaviyo or Omnisend. This helps you quickly spot issues like missing marketing profiles, unsubscribed statuses, or unverified emails — common reasons behind missing reward emails, failed flows, or identity mismatches.

### [hashtag](#actions-you-can-take) **Actions you can take**

#### [hashtag](#adjust-points) **Adjust points**

Use this when a customer is missing points, needs a correction after a refund, or requires goodwill compensation. You can add or subtract points, choose whether the adjustment affects VIP tier progression, and leave an internal note or a customer-facing message. This is also where you can manually fix balance issues.

circle-info

Remember that you can add and deduct point balance

#### [hashtag](#redeem-rewards) **Redeem rewards**

Create a reward coupon on behalf of the customer. This is helpful when the customer cannot redeem points themselves, needs a backup code after losing or misusing the original one, or when you want to generate a reward manually during support. You can select any active redeeming program, generate the coupon instantly, and confirm that the points are deducted correctly.

#### [hashtag](#revoke-coupons) **Revoke coupons**

Cancel an unused coupon and automatically restore the customer’s points. This is useful for duplicated codes, customer mistakes, or unused rewards that need to be reset.

#### [hashtag](#exclude-customer-from-program) **Exclude customer from program**

Remove a customer from earning or redeeming loyalty points when needed — for example, for wholesale accounts, staff accounts, or internal testing. Once excluded, the customer will not gain new points or access rewards unless you re-enable them. See more at [other post](/customers/excluding-customers-from-loyalty-program) about this.

#### [hashtag](#change-customer-tier) **Change customer tier**

Update a customer’s VIP tier when a manual correction is needed — for example, honoring a special case, fixing a miscalculated upgrade, or granting a tier as part of support. Along with changing the tier itself, you can also edit the customer’s **tier points**, which directly affects their progress within that tier. This gives you full control to correct mistakes, reset progress, or align the customer’s VIP status with your policies.

#### [hashtag](#recalculate-vip-tier-point) **Recalculate VIP tier point**

If you’ve manually changed a customer’s tier points and want to undo that change, you can use the recalculate option. This resets the tier points based on the customer’s actual order history and earning activity. It’s a quick way to restore accurate progress when you change your mind or want the system to recalculate everything automatically.

### [hashtag](#in-short) In short

A loyalty program grows through what your customers do every day — earning, redeeming, referring, ordering as guests, or returning to shop again.
**Customer Management** is where you keep all of this running smoothly. It’s where you maintain accurate data, support your customers, and understand every step of their loyalty journey.
