### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

**Q: Can I search for customers by name instead of email?**
A: Currently, Quick Search works with email addresses, order IDs, and coupon codes. Customer names aren't searchable through this feature.

**Q: Why don't I see results for a program I know exists?**
A: Make sure you're using the exact program title or ID. Try searching with just part of the program name if the full title doesn't work.

**Q: Can I search for expired or deleted programs?**
A: Quick Search only shows active programs. To view expired or deleted programs, use the filter options in your main programs section.

**Q: What if I can't remember the exact coupon code?**
A: Try searching with just the prefix you set up (like "JOY-" or "SUMMER"). This might help you find similar codes.

**Q: Does Quick Search work on mobile?**
A: Yes, Quick Search works on all devices. The search bar adapts to your screen size for easy mobile use.
