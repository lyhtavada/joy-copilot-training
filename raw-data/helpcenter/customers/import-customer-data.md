**FAQ: Does adjusting a customer's points affect their tier status?**

Currently, adjusting a customer's points does not affect their tier status.

The customer's tier will only change according to the settings in [VIP Tierarrow-up-right](https://help.joy.so/membership/vip-tiers#how-to-set-up-vip-tiers-feature) or if you manually adjust the tier on the customer's detailed information page.

**Important note:**

- You must name the column **'Birthday(MM/DD)'.**
- You must enter data in the format MM/DD (**xx month/ xx date**), for example: 03/03 is the correct format, while 3/3 is incorrect."
