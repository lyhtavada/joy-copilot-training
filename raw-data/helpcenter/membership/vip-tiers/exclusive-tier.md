This feature is available for: **Advanced, and Enterprise** plans

### [hashtag](#who-can-use-this-feature) Who can use this feature

This feature is available for merchants on Joy Advanced plans and above who want to create special membership tiers outside of the traditional VIP tier system.

### [hashtag](#what-are-exclusive-tiers) What are exclusive tiers

Exclusive tiers are special membership levels that you manually assign to specific customers, separate from your regular VIP tier system. Unlike VIP tiers that customers earn through spending or points, exclusive tiers allow you to provide targeted benefits to select customer groups with full control over membership.

### [hashtag](#why-you-should-use-exclusive-tiers) Why you should use exclusive tiers

Exclusive tiers give you complete control over who receives premium benefits, regardless of spending history. This is perfect for rewarding brand ambassadors, wholesale clients, influencers, or any special group based on criteria other than purchase behavior.

Traditional VIP tiers work automatically, but exclusive tiers let you create personalized experiences for hand-picked customers while keeping your regular loyalty program running for everyone else.
