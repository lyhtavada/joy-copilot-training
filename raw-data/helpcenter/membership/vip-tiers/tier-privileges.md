### [hashtag](#what-are-tier-privileges) What are Tier Privileges

Tier Privileges (also known as Perks) allow you to offer exclusive rewards to customers based on their loyalty tier status. These rewards can include discount amounts, discount percentages, free shipping, free products, bonus points, and custom rewards.

With the improved Tier Privileges feature, you can now add multiple instances of the same discount type within a single tier. For example, you can create several different discount amount rewards for your Gold tier members, each applying to different products or collections.

### [hashtag](#why-do-you-need-tier-privileges-perks) Why do you need Tier Privileges (Perks)?

Tier Privileges also have a significant impact on purchase behavior. By offering special discounts and perks, you encourage customers to add more items to their cart to maximize their exclusive benefits, effectively boosting your average order value. Meanwhile, your VIP customers enjoy an enhanced shopping experience where they feel genuinely valued through access to benefits that aren't available to everyone else.

From a competitive standpoint, a well-designed tier privileges system helps your loyalty program stand out in the marketplace. When customers can clearly see the increasing benefits as they progress through your tiers, they're motivated to reach higher levels—creating a natural progression path that drives engagement. And with the ability to now add multiple discount types targeting specific products or collections, you can create a highly customized shopping experience that aligns perfectly with your business strategy and customer preferences.

### [hashtag](#understanding-the-rules) Understanding the Rules

Tier Privileges are set by the merchant and can include one or more rewards. Once a member reaches a specific tier, all their orders automatically receive the associated benefits. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Select Rewards**: Merchants choose rewards like discounts, free shipping, products, or bonus points.
- **Automatic Application**: Once a member reaches a tier, selected rewards are automatically applied to all future orders.

Before setting up your rewards, it's important to understand the difference between Tier Privileges and Tier Entry Rewards:

#### [hashtag](#id-1.-what-is-tier-entry-rewards) 1. What is Tier Entry Rewards

"Entry rewards" are incentives given to customers when they join a loyalty program or reach a new tier, designed to boost engagement and retention with immediate benefits. "Entry rewards" are valid for one-time use only.

#### [hashtag](#id-2.-the-difference-between-tier-privileges-and-tier-new-entry-rewards) 2. The difference between Tier Privileges and Tier New Entry Rewards

The key difference is that Tier Privileges offer ongoing benefits for all purchases once a tier is reached, while Tier New Entry Rewards provide one-time incentives when customers reach a new tier. Privileges encourage long-term loyalty, while Entry Rewards offer immediate incentives.

### [hashtag](#important-note) Important Note

#### [hashtag](#id-1.-combinate-discounts) 1. **Combinate discounts**

When you use the combinations feature with privileges rewards, for order discounts, if there are more than two discount programs, only the one with the highest discount will be applied.

**Example:** A gold-tier member will enjoy privileges including a 10% discount, $10 off, and free shipping. So, when this member purchases an order worth $200, they will receive a $20 discount (10% off) and free shipping

#### [hashtag](#id-2.-set-up-a-maximum-of-privileges-rewards) 2. Set up a maximum of privileges rewards

Currently, you can set up a maximum of 5 privileges rewards across all tiers. This means the total number of privileges rewards from all tiers cannot exceed 5.

### [hashtag](#important-considerations) Important considerations

circle-info

**Multiple discount handling**

When multiple discounts could apply to the same product, Shopify will automatically apply the discount that gives the customer the highest value. For example:

- If a Gold tier member has both a 10% discount and a $10 fixed discount privilege, and they purchase a $50 item, they'll receive the $10 discount (since 10% would only be $5).
- If they purchase a $200 item, they'll receive the 10% discount ($20), as it's more valuable than the $10 fixed discount.

circle-info

**Automatic discount limitations**

- While Shopify now allows up to 25 automatic discounts, it's best to use them strategically to avoid confusion.
- If you had privileges set up before this enhancement, they will be migrated to the new system the first time you update an existing discount.

circle-info

**Migration of existing privileges**

When you update an existing tier privilege:

1. The system will automatically migrate your privileges to the new format
2. Each privilege will be separated into its own individual automatic discount
3. Your existing settings will be preserved during this migration

New privileges added after the migration will follow the new structure automatically.

### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

#### [hashtag](#will-all-my-privileges-work-immediately-after-migration) Will all my privileges work immediately after migration?

Yes, the migration process is designed to maintain all your existing privileges without disruption. The only change is in how they're managed behind the scenes.

#### [hashtag](#is-there-a-limit-to-how-many-privileges-i-can-add-to-a-single-tier) Is there a limit to how many privileges I can add to a single tier?

While you can technically add up to 25 automatic discounts across all tiers (Shopify's limit), we recommend keeping your tier benefits clear and manageable. Consider what makes sense for your customers and what you can effectively promote.

#### [hashtag](#can-i-still-use-tier-entry-rewards-alongside-tier-privileges) Can I still use Tier Entry Rewards alongside Tier Privileges?

Absolutely! Tier Entry Rewards and Tier Privileges serve different purposes and work well together. Entry rewards provide immediate gratification when customers reach a new tier, while privileges offer ongoing benefits that encourage customers to maintain their status.

#### [hashtag](#what-happens-to-privileges-when-a-customer-changes-tiers) What happens to privileges when a customer changes tiers?

When a customer moves to a higher tier, they'll lose access to their previous tier's privileges and gain access to their new tier's privileges. If they drop to a lower tier, the same process applies in reverse.

#### [hashtag](#will-my-customers-be-confused-if-they-see-multiple-discounts) Will my customers be confused if they see multiple discounts?

Customers will only see the automatic discount that gives them the highest value applied to their order. The others will not appear at checkout, preventing confusion.
