Tier configuration settings

**Tier calculating rule:** Define the method for calculating customer tiers. You can choose between **Points earned**, **Amount spent**, and **Number of orders**. Choosing between them depends on how you want to structure your program.

- **Points earned**: Tiers depend on total points collected, including from purchases, referrals, and reviews. This encourages broader engagement beyond spending.
- **Amount spent**: Tiers are based on total spending. Ideal if you want to reward high spenders. Customers still earn and use points for rewards.
- **Number of orders**: Tiers are based on how many orders a customer has placed. Great for stores that value frequent purchases — customers unlock higher tiers as they complete more orders, encouraging consistent shopping behavior.

**Discount code's prefix**: Personalize the prefix for discount codes generated within your VIP Tiers program. Make it match your brand.

**Note**: the code's prefix must be in the format ABCD-

**Tiers settings**

**Tier name:** Use a branded tier name to make the program exclusive.

When using **Number of orders** rule, each tier requires a minimum number of completed orders to qualify. For example, Silver = 5 orders, Gold = 15 orders, Platinum = 30 orders.

**Entry reward:** choose the reward(s) for customers when they reach the tier

**Set up Entry reward**

With entry rewards, you can set up the entry reward to be the following types:

- **Discount amount**
- **Discount percentage**
- **Bonus point**
- **Free product**
- **Free Shipping**
- **Buy X get Y**
- **Custom rewards:** Use this if you have a specific perk that cannot be programatically set up.

**Applicable categories**: choose the product or collection that customers can use discounts

**Operating time:** expiration time of the reward.

**Condition:** combine the discounts and channels applied

It is highly recommended NOT to add entry rewards to your lowest tier, which may issue a massive amount of rewards for unwanted customers. You should provide entry rewards for higher tier level only.

### [hashtag](#conclusion-2) FAQs

**What should I choose: points earned, amount spent, or number of orders?** All three methods work well, but the best choice depends on your business goals:

- **Points earned**: Tiers depend on total points collected, including from purchases, referrals, and reviews. This encourages broad engagement beyond just spending.
- **Amount spent**: Tiers are based on total spending. This works well if you want to reward high spenders while keeping points as an incentive for redemptions.
- **Number of orders**: Tiers are based on how many orders a customer has placed. This is great for stores with lower average order values (e.g. cosmetics, fashion accessories) where purchase frequency matters more than spending amount. Customers see a clear, simple goal: "Place 3 more orders to reach Gold." Even with amount spent or number of orders, points remain valuable for redemptions and keeping customers engaged.

**How are orders counted for the "Number of orders" rule?** Only completed (fulfilled/paid) orders are counted. Cancelled, refunded, or pending orders do not count toward tier progression. If an order is refunded after the customer has already reached a tier, the tier will be re-evaluated based on your tier demotion settings.

**Can I switch from "Points earned" or "Amount spent" to "Number of orders"?** Yes, you can change the tier calculating rule at any time. When you switch, the system will re-evaluate all customers based on their order history and assign them to the appropriate tier. We recommend using the "Relaunch" feature after changing the rule to ensure all customers are correctly placed.
