### [hashtag](#what-is-the-b2b-vip-tier-feature) What is the B2B VIP Tier feature

The B2B VIP Tier feature provides specialized loyalty tiers designed exclusively for business customers. Unlike regular tiers that focus on individual consumers, B2B tiers offer benefits that matter to business buyers, such as payment terms, catalog access restrictions, volume-based discounts, and company-wide tier management.

This feature integrates seamlessly with Shopify's B2B functionality to provide personalized experiences based on how much a business has spent over their lifetime relationship with your store. Companies automatically inherit tier benefits that apply to all business account members.

### [hashtag](#why-you-should-use-b2b-vip-tiers) Why you should use B2B VIP Tiers

B2B VIP Tiers create powerful incentives for businesses to increase their spending while providing appropriate rewards for your highest-value customers. Unlike individual loyalty programs, B2B tiers recognize that business purchases are typically higher value, recurring, and involve multiple decision-makers within the organization.

These specialized tiers help you retain valuable business customers by offering benefits that align with B2B purchasing patterns. Extended payment terms, access to exclusive product catalogs, and volume discounts all address the specific needs of business buyers. When companies see clear progression paths and increasingly valuable benefits, they're motivated to consolidate their purchasing with your business.

#### [hashtag](#how-are-company-tiers-calculated) How are company tiers calculated?

Tiers are calculated based on the total lifetime spending of the entire company across all company members and locations. This includes historical orders placed before the tier system was launched.

#### [hashtag](#what-happens-when-a-company-changes-tiers) What happens when a company changes tiers?

When a company moves to a new tier:

- Benefits apply immediately to all company members
- Changes are reflected in the next order placed
- Previous tier benefits are removed automatically
- All company locations inherit the new tier level

#### [hashtag](#can-i-create-different-tier-structures-for-different-types-of-businesses) Can I create different tier structures for different types of businesses?

Currently, B2B VIP Tiers uses a single tier structure that applies to all B2B customers. You can use Shopify's customer tags or metafields for additional segmentation if needed.

#### [hashtag](#how-do-refunds-affect-tier-status) How do refunds affect tier status?

Refunds reduce the company's lifetime spending total. If a refund causes the company to fall below their current tier's threshold, they will be automatically downgraded to the appropriate tier level.

#### [hashtag](#will-tier-specific-discounts-stack-with-my-other-discounts) Will tier-specific discounts stack with my other discounts?

Tier discounts are automatically applied, but how they combine with other discounts depends on your Shopify discount stacking settings. Generally, the best discount available will be applied to the customer.
