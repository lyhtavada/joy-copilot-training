### [hashtag](#what-is-the-available-rewards-block) What is the Available Rewards Block

The Available Rewards block is a Shopify UI extension that displays all available rewards that customers can redeem with their loyalty points directly on your store pages. This block shows customers exactly what they can earn with their current point balance, encouraging immediate redemption and engagement with your loyalty program.

### [hashtag](#why-you-should-use-the-available-rewards-block) Why you should use the Available Rewards Block

Displaying available rewards directly on your store pages creates immediate visibility for your loyalty program benefits. When customers can see exactly what rewards they can claim with their current points, they're more likely to engage with your loyalty program and make purchases to reach reward thresholds.

This embedded block increases loyalty program engagement by removing the friction of accessing a separate loyalty page or widget. Customers can browse rewards without leaving their current shopping experience, leading to higher redemption rates and increased customer lifetime value.
