### [hashtag](#what-is-the-quick-redeem-block) What is the Quick Redeem Block

The Quick Redeem block is a streamlined Shopify UI extension that provides customers with instant access to their most relevant loyalty rewards. This compact block focuses on immediate redemption opportunities, showing only the rewards customers can currently afford with their point balance, making the redemption process fast and friction-free.

### [hashtag](#why-you-should-use-the-quick-redeem-block) Why you should use the Quick Redeem Block

The Quick Redeem block removes barriers to reward redemption by presenting only actionable options to customers. Instead of overwhelming them with all available rewards, it focuses on what they can immediately claim, leading to higher conversion rates and increased customer satisfaction.

This block is particularly effective for increasing impulse redemptions and can be strategically placed throughout your store to capture moments when customers are most likely to redeem rewards, such as during checkout or after adding items to their cart.
