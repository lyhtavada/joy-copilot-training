### [hashtag](#what-is-this-feature) What is this feature

The Referral Block is a customizable widget that appears on your checkout success page, encouraging customers to refer friends immediately after completing their purchase. This feature transforms your Thank you page into a powerful conversion tool that captures the customer's post-purchase excitement to drive new customer acquisition through word-of-mouth marketing.

### [hashtag](#why-users-should-use-this-feature) Why users should use this feature

The post-purchase moment represents peak customer satisfaction and engagement. Customers are significantly more likely to make referrals immediately after a positive purchasing experience when their excitement is highest. This feature capitalizes on this optimal moment, turning the traditionally passive Thank you page into an active revenue-generating touchpoint that drives referral conversions.
