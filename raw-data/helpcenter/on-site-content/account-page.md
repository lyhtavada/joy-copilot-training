The Account Page centralizes your customers' loyalty program information in one convenient location. It displays their points balance, tier status, available rewards, earning history, and referral opportunities.

By integrating loyalty features directly into your existing account interface, you create a seamless experience that encourages program participation without requiring customers to navigate to separate pages.
