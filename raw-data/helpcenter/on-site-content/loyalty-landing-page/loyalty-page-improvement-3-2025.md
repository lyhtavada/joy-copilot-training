We see that the Loyalty page feature is one of the most loved features of ours. Customers spend a lot of time using it every day. It would be best that building your loyalty page should be an ease. We have made a few improvements to upgrade the experience

### [hashtag](#our-improvements) Our improvements

#### [hashtag](#logged-in-and-logged-out-state-toggle) Logged-in and logged-out state toggle

Inside the loyalty page, we will have a floating toggle button for you to easily mimic logged-in and logged-out states without needing to actually log in.

#### [hashtag](#browse-images-and-remove-background-utilities) Browse images and remove background utilities

You are setting a loyalty page with a free gift program, you may want to include your product images inside the loyalty page, but you have to go to your store, grab your product image URL, and place it in the loyalty page. However, you realize that this image is not transparent, so you need to do it all over again after removing the background with an online tool. We understand that pain. We have updated the UX to make it less painful.

No more of every update is another time spinning of the loaders of blocks. We optimized and cached the result to improve UX.

### [hashtag](#lastly) Lastly

We still actively monitor, test and curate our app experience so that it is getting better and better. We will also keep customers posted on our updates.
