### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

**Will the app verify if a customer has fully completed the social media action before awarding points?**

Due to technical limitations imposed by social media platforms, we’re unable to verify whether a customer has completed the action through direct APIs or webhooks.

However, similar to other loyalty programs, our app relies on a trust-based system. It guides customers to your social media profiles, and our data indicates that the majority of users follow through with the actions. Rest assured, most customers will engage with your social media as intended.
