### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

#### [hashtag](#can-i-have-an-anti-cheat-for-shopify-flow-powered-integration-like-with-direct-api-integrations) Can I have an anti-cheat for Shopify-Flow-powered integration like with direct API integrations?

Unfortunately, we cannot control that. It depends on whether the trigger from the reviews app providing that mechanism or not.

#### [hashtag](#can-i-reward-more-if-the-review-includes-images-or-video) Can I reward more if the review includes images or video?

Yes, you can. With direct API integration, we have an option for that and it is on Advanced plan.

However, with Shopify-Flow-powered integrations, it depends on the trigger include a variable for you to set the condition or not.
