### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

1. **What currency do you use to calculate the points rewards?**

We work with the store's main currency which works in your Shopify admin.

All points will be converted to the main currency and then the reward rate will be implemented to this total amount.

1. **Are shipping and taxes included in the calculation of points rewarded?**

If you choose the reward customer on the amount they spent as below, then it is: no, they are not.

We will only add up the total price of the products matching the conditions (you can whitelist some of the products out of the program) in the order.
