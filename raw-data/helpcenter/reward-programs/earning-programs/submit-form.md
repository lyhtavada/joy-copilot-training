### [hashtag](#user-content-overview) Overview

Submit Form is an earning program for actions that can't be tracked automatically — like sharing on social media, posting UGC content, or leaving feedback on external platforms. Customers complete the task, submit proof via a customizable form, and receive rewards after admin approval.

**Use case:** Merchants wanting to reward social shares, TikTok posts with hashtags, Google reviews, UGC content, or any custom action.
