### [hashtag](#how-customers-experience-birthday-rewards) How customers experience birthday rewards

The customer experience differs based on your configuration settings. How customers receive and interact with their birthday rewards depends on whether you choose automatic or manual reward delivery.

#### [hashtag](#automatic-rewards) Automatic rewards

With automatic rewards, the system seamlessly handles the entire reward process without requiring customer action. When customers become eligible based on your timing settings, points are automatically added to their account. They'll see a notification in the loyalty widget informing them of their birthday reward, and they can use these points immediately without any additional steps.

#### [hashtag](#manual-rewards) Manual rewards

Manual rewards create an interactive experience that encourages customer engagement with your loyalty program. When customers become eligible for their birthday reward, they'll see a notification in the loyalty widget alerting them to their available reward. To receive their points, they must take action by clicking the "Claim now" button. After claiming, they'll see a confirmation that points have been added to their account and can then use these points for available rewards.

### [hashtag](#can-i-set-up-multiple-rewards-not-just-one-for-customers) Can I set up multiple rewards not just one for customers?

Yes, with the new update, it’s possible if the Rule engine is enabled. Merchants can now configure multiple birthday rewards for users instead of being limited to just one. You can allow customers to:

- **Preview or preselect rewards** up to 30 days before their birthday.
- **Receive multiple reward options** (e.g., points, discounts, or gifts), and each VIP tier can be configured with different reward sets.
- If set to **automatic reward**, users will get a default reward on their birthday. If set to **manual claim**, the reward will expire 30 days after the birthday if not claimed.
- Each year, users can re-select their birthday reward for the next cycle.

This gives merchants more flexibility to design engaging and tier-based birthday experiences.

**Note:** If you're using old version, please delete current birthday program and create a new one.
