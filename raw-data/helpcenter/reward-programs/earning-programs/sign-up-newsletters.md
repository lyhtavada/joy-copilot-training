### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

#### [hashtag](#my-customers-have-subscribed-but-are-still-not-getting-points-why) My customers have subscribed but are still not getting points, why?

One of the most common causes is that you are using double-opt-in for the newsletter. This will make the marketing status in your Shopify as "pending" so our system can't add reward yet. It is the same with any form from any other apps: Klavyo form, Shopify form, etc. It is the Shopify marketing status that we process, not whether the form is submitted or not.
