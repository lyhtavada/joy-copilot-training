### [hashtag](#discover-joy) **Types of Point Expiration**

You can define how points expire across your reward program. Below are the available expiration types:

---

#### [hashtag](#id-1.-full-point-expiration.-all-customers) **1.** Full point expiration. **(All Customers)**

All customers' entire point balances will expire if they have been inactive (no new purchases or earning activities) for a specific period set by you.

- This rule applies to the entire point balance of a customer.
- Reset Mechanism: If a customer earns or spends points (engages with the program) before the expiration date, the expiration timer for their entire balance will reset.
- Example: If expiration is set to 365 days:

  - Customer A earns points on Jan 1st.
  - If they do nothing, points expire on Dec 31st.
  - If they make a new purchase on June 1st, the new expiration date for *all* their points will be extended to May 31st of the following year (1 year from the latest activity).

---

#### [hashtag](#id-2.-fixed-date-expiration-all-customers) **2. Fixed Date Expiration (All Customers)**

All customers’ points expire on a specific calendar date, regardless of when the points were earned.

- This rule applies to **all points of all customers**.
- Example: All points expire on **December 31** each year.
- Use this for seasonal resets or annual loyalty programs.

---

#### [hashtag](#id-3.-point-expiration-based-on-earning-date-first-in-first-out) **3. Point Expiration Based on Earning Date (First-In, First-Out)**

Points expire based on the order they were earned, where **earliest-earned points expire first**.

- This rule applies to **all customers and all points**.
- Older points will expire before newer points.
- Example:

  - 100 points earned on Dec 26 → expire first
  - 200 points earned on Dec 27 → expire later
- Use this to align point expiration with earning chronology and minimize the loss of older points.
