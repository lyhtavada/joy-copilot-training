### [hashtag](#how-discount-combinations-work) How Discount combinations work

Allow customers to stack eligible discounts for the best total discount, combining both automatic discounts and discount codes.

Each discount that you create belongs to one of the following categories, depending on what the discount applies to:

- Order discount
- Product discount
- Shipping discount

You can choose which discount categories combine. For example, a 10% order discount code can be combined with product discount codes.

If a customer enters more than one discount code during checkout that can't be combined, they'll see this message: "Discount couldn't be used with your existing discounts.

#### [hashtag](#i-changed-the-discount-combination-setting.-will-it-affect-a-previously-redeemed-discount) I changed the Discount combination setting. Will it affect a previously redeemed discount?
