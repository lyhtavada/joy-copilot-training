### [hashtag](#what-is-pending-points) What is Pending Points?

Pending Points is a feature in Joy Loyalty that introduces a delay in making points available after a purchase. Unlike the traditional system where points are instantly credited, Pending Points helps merchants manage returns and reduce fraud by holding points in a pending status for a set period. This gives merchants greater control over when points are fully available for use in loyalty programs.

### [hashtag](#why-do-you-need-pending-points) Why do you need Pending Points?

Pending Points offer several benefits for your store:

1. **Prevents Fraud**: Points are delayed until the order is fully confirmed, reducing the risk of fraud.
2. **Manages Returns**: Merchants can avoid giving points for returns, ensuring only valid purchases earn rewards.
3. **More Control**: Merchants can control when points are available, offering flexibility for their loyalty program.
4. **Accurate Loyalty Program**: This feature helps maintain a reliable and fair loyalty system by awarding points only for completed purchases.

Pending Points help you protect their business, streamline their rewards system, and build customer trust.

### [hashtag](#best-practice-who-should-need-pending-points-feature) Best practice: Who should need Pending points feature?

Pending Points is ideal for merchants with a return policy or concerns about fraud. It benefits:

- **Stores with Return Policies**: Delays points until after the return period to prevent exploitation.
- **Merchants Seeking Fraud Prevention**: Helps deter fraudulent behavior by making points usable only after a set time.
- **Businesses Needing Better Point Management**: Offers control over when points are awarded, ensuring rewards are only given after certain conditions are met.

For example:

**Problem**: Customers are exploiting the system by placing multiple orders, earning points, redeeming rewards, and then returning the items.

**Solution**: Implement Pending Points with an 8-day delay, so customers must wait until after the return period to use points, preventing fraud and protecting the store.
