### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

#### [hashtag](#can-we-dynamically-translate-content-in-this-checkout-ui-block-by-ip-or-browser-language) Can we dynamically translate content in this checkout UI block by IP or browser language?

Unfortunately, we cannot. This is due to Shopify's limit with the [Checkout UIarrow-up-right](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions) extensions. We can have input in the Theme Editor to change the default translation language to one main language at the checkout only, unlike the loyalty page and widget. Hopefully, in the future, Shopify will support i18n for this.
