### [hashtag](#what-is-discount-program-feature) What is "Discount program" feature?

The discount program allows customers to use their accumulated points to receive a discount on their purchases. Each discount becomes a unique, one-time-use coupon code that's automatically generated for your customers when they redeem their points.

### [hashtag](#why-do-you-need-this-feature) Why do you need this feature?

A points-to-discount program is a powerful tool for growing your business. When customers can easily turn their points into discounts, they're more likely to return to your store and make repeat purchases. Not only does this increase your average order value, but it also helps you stand out from competitors. We've seen merchants significantly boost their sales with this simple yet effective way to reward customer loyalty. Think of it as an investment in your customers that pays off in long-term business growth!

#### [hashtag](#can-we-choose-the-purchase-type-both-or-subscription-without-a-subscription-app-installed) Can we choose the purchase type, both or subscription, without a subscription app installed?

No, you should not. The Shopify API does not allow us to do that. If you do not have [a subscription apparrow-up-right](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=subscription&st_source=autocomplete) installed, you had better choose the One-time purchase option. If not, you may see a message like: "applies\_on\_subscription field is not permitted without the shop using subscriptions"
