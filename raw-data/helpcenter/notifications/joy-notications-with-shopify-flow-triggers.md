By integrating it with Joy Loyalty, you can set up automated actions based on specific triggers, making it easier to manage loyalty rewards, customer notifications, and more. This integration helps save time, reduce manual tasks, and improve customer satisfaction.

Below is a list of triggers provided by Joy Loyalty along with a brief description of how to use each trigger:

1. **Tier Demotion Reminder**: Automatically notify customers when they are about to be demoted to a lower tier due to inactivity or other conditions.
2. **Point Expiration Date Reminder**: Send reminders to customers when their loyalty points are about to expire, encouraging them to redeem points before the deadline.
3. **VIP Tier Reset Reminder**: Alert VIP customers before their tier status resets, ensuring they stay engaged and aware of their loyalty status.
4. **7 Days Before Customer's Birthday**: Send a special offer or reminder to customers a week before their birthday, enhancing personalization and engagement.
5. **Customer's Birthday**: Automatically send birthday greetings or special offers to customers on their birthday.
6. **Coupons for Referrers**: Reward customers with coupons when they successfully refer a friend to your store.
7. **Customer Has Enough Points for Reward**: Notify customers when they have earned enough points to redeem a reward, encouraging them to take action.
8. **Earn Points**: Automatically add points to a customer's account when they complete certain actions like making a purchase or writing a review.
9. **Points for Referrers**: Award points to customers who refer new customers to your store.
10. **POS Point Redemption**: Enable customers to redeem points directly at the point of sale, enhancing in-store experiences.
11. **Redeem Points**: Automate the process of point redemption, ensuring customers receive their rewards seamlessly.
12. **Referral for Friend**: Track and reward customers who refer their friends to your store.
13. **VIP Tier Downgraded**: Inform customers when they are downgraded from a VIP tier, providing opportunities to re-engage them.
14. **VIP Tier Reset**: Automatically reset VIP tiers based on your loyalty program rules and notify customers of their new status.
15. **VIP Tier Achieved**: Celebrate with customers when they achieve a VIP tier, enhancing their sense of accomplishment and loyalty.

Here is an example of how to use the "1 day Pre-tier demotion Reminder" trigger from Joy to create a workflow. When this workflow is enabled, it will send a reminder email to customers one day before they are due to be demoted to a lower tier. This email will prompt customers to earn more points to avoid being downgraded, provided their lower tier name is not Bronze.

**Note:** You can read more about using Joy's triggers to create workflows by checking the guides in the Shopify Flow section. If you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to contact us!

### [hashtag](#joys-action) Joy's Action

When Joy is in the Shopify Flow action position, Joy loyalty allows customers to perform the following actions:

1. **Add point:** Add approved points to a customer.
2. **Subtract point:** Subtract approved points from a customer.

Here is an example of how to use the "Add Points" action from Joy to create a workflow. When the "Order Created" trigger detects that a customer has made a purchase, and if it is their fifth order, the customer will be awarded additional loyalty points.
