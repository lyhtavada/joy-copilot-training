### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

#### [hashtag](#what-email-marketing-status-will-be-set-when-a-customer-is-synced-to-mailchimp) What email marketing status will be set when a customer is synced to MailChimp?

We use Mailchimp API to sync these customers from our app. MailChimp provides an option to register for Email Marketing status if this customer does not exist in the MailChimp list. It is possible that we can register new profiles as subscribed. However, if a customer existed in your Mailchimp account but manually unsubscribed or opted out, there is no way we can update the status.
