### [hashtag](#faq) FAQ

**Q: Why didn’t my customers receive points after submitting a review?**
**A:** This usually happens when Joy does not have the required permissions to receive review events from Klaviyo. If Klaviyo was connected before, you must disconnect and reconnect it to grant the latest permissions.

**Q: Can a customer earn points multiple times for the same product?**
**A:** Yes but you can limit it in the "Fraud prevention set up"

**Q: Does Joy sync existing reviews from Klaviyo?**
**A:** No. Joy only tracks **new reviews** submitted after the integration is connected. Reviews created before the connection will not be rewarded retroactively.
