### [hashtag](#understanding-the-rule) Understanding the Rule

Integrating Joy Loyalty with Joy Subscription automatically links subscription purchases to your reward system. Customers who subscribe to products will receive loyalty points for every payment cycle, just as they would for a standard one-time purchase.

The points can be configured based on the merchant’s preferences, either for each purchase or by total spend. This means customers are incentivized to stay subscribed, as they will accumulate points with each recurring payment. You can also define specific rules, such as limiting which subscription products are eligible for rewards or which customer segments qualify for the loyalty program.

### [hashtag](#why-do-you-need-this-integration) Why do you need this integration?

Many subscription-based businesses face challenges with customer retention, but rewarding customers through a loyalty program can significantly improve their long-term engagement. By offering points for subscription renewals, merchants provide an ongoing incentive for customers to keep their subscriptions active.

This creates a cycle of value where customers feel more appreciated and motivated to continue purchasing. Additionally, rewarding subscription purchases can differentiate your business from competitors, making your service more attractive. For merchants, this leads to better customer retention rates, increased lifetime value (LTV), and higher satisfaction.
