### [hashtag](#introduction) Introduction

Two of the most common use cases when integrating **Joy Loyalty** with a **subscription app** are:

1. **Rewarding customers for subscription orders**
2. **Allowing customers to redeem coupons for their subscription cycles**

Both use cases work out of the box with most subscription apps that use [**Shopify Selling Plans**arrow-up-right](https://www.shopify.com/blog/sales-planning) **and Contracts** — the standard set by [Shopify’s own Subscription apparrow-up-right](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions). If your subscription app follows this standard, Joy will work seamlessly with it.

#### [hashtag](#supported-subscription-apps-tested) Supported subscription apps (tested)

You can find the list of officially supported integrations on the **Integration** page inside our app.
For these apps, make sure you’ve set up your **selling plans** and **subscription products** before continuing.

#### [hashtag](#setting-up-rewards-for-subscription-orders) Setting up rewards for subscription orders

To start rewarding points for subscription orders:

1. Go to **Rewards programs,** you can create or edit the default subscription order program
2. Ensure your subscription app and selling plans are already installed and active.
3. Click **“I have a subscription app & plan”** to confirm setup.
4. Configure the reward conditions just like any other earning rule — set how many points customers earn, define eligible conditions, and save the program.

Once complete, activate the program and place a test subscription order to confirm points are being earned correctly.

Once done, you can turn on the program and test if the subscription orders are earning or not.

#### [hashtag](#set-up-the-discount-redemption-for-the-subscription) Set up the discount redemption for the subscription

To let customers redeem points for subscription discounts:

1. Create a new **Redeeming program**.
2. Under **Purchase type**, choose whether the discount applies to:

   - **Both** one-time and subscription purchases, or
   - **Each separately** (recommended: create different programs for each type).
3. In the **Conditions** section, enable the option **“Recurring payments for subscriptions”** if you want the discount to apply to multiple cycles.

> 💡 Most merchants choose to let coupons apply to **only one cycle** to avoid ongoing discounts for the same redemption.

Once a customer redeems a coupon, each of their active subscriptions will have its own **subscription management page**. You can visit each page and apply the coupon to the corresponding subscription as needed.

#### [hashtag](#faqs) FAQs

**1. Do I need a specific subscription app for this integration?**
No. Joy works with most subscription apps that follow Shopify’s **Selling Plans and Contracts** standard. Popular options like Recharge, Appstle, and Seal Subscriptions are supported out of the box. But if it is an outdated app with no Shopify Selling Plan, sorry, it is a no.

**2. Can customers earn points from every subscription renewal?**
Yes. If your earning program is set to reward **Subscription orders**, points will be added automatically for each renewal order processed through Shopify.

**3. Will redeemed coupons apply to all future subscription cycles?**
By default, coupons apply to **one subscription cycle** only. If you’d like them to apply to recurring payments, enable the **“Recurring payments for subscriptions”** condition in your redemption setup.

**4. How can I apply a redeemed coupon to a subscription?**
After a customer redeems a coupon, go to their **subscription management page** in your subscription app. Each subscription has its own page where the coupon can be applied individually.

**5. Can I create separate reward rules for one-time and subscription purchases?**
Yes. We recommend setting up **separate programs** for one-time and subscription purchases to ensure full control and avoid overlapping discounts.
