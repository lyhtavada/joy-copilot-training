After Joy Loyalty reads your file and reports the number of successful and failed customer imports, follow these steps to ensure no customers are missed:

1. Download the processed file from the **FailedImports** section.
2. Open the file (a spreadsheet) and apply a filter on the **Status** column to display only the failed customers.
3. Review the error messages and correct the failed values.
