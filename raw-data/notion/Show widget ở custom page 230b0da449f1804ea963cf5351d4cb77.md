# Show widget ở custom page

Category: Onsite content

💡 Idea

It's become clear that many merchants prefer to display the widget on specific pages rather than across all pages, as per the app's default setting. While the app currently allows merchants to select default pages (home, product, collection, cart, and blog pages), it does not yet support the option to choose a specific page URL.

In light of this, we've created a setting in Dev Zone that enables customer support to activate the option to display the widget on custom pages for merchants who are interested.

➡️ Flow

After merchants spend around 20 seconds on the Widget design page, an automatic message will pop up, asking if they would like to display the widget on a custom page.

If they respond via chat with the pre-written message **“Yes, I’d love to”**, Customer Support should follow the normal "Enable feature" flow. This involves asking for the store URL and the specific page URL where they want to display the widget.

Once all necessary information is gathered, CS can access Dev Zone and enable the option.

Once this option is enabled, the **Custom Page** setting will be added to the **Page Restriction** section under **Advanced Settings**, allowing merchants to specify the pages where they want the widget to appear.

CS will need to copy and paste the URLs provided by the merchant into the **Custom Page** setting and save the changes. Afterward, CS should notify the merchant about the update and ask them to check if the widget is displaying as desired.

Once the session concludes, CS can also guide the merchant on how to adjust this setting on their own in the future and offer some widget placement suggestions (highly recommended).

**Finally, CS should request a review from the merchant at an appropriate time.**
