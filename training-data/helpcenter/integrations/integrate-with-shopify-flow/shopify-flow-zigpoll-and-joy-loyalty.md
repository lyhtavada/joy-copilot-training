### What is [Zigpoll](https://www.zigpoll.com/) Integration via Shopify Flow

Zigpoll Integration via Shopify Flow allows you to automatically reward customers with loyalty points when they complete surveys created with Zigpoll. This integration uses Shopify Flow's automation capabilities to trigger point awards based on survey completion events, creating a seamless connection between your feedback collection and loyalty program.

The integration works by setting up a Flow automation that listens for Zigpoll survey completion events and automatically awards points to customers through Joy Loyalty's API, encouraging more customers to participate in your surveys and providing valuable feedback.

### Why you should use this integration

Customer feedback is invaluable for business growth, but getting customers to complete surveys can be challenging. By integrating Zigpoll with your loyalty program through Shopify Flow, you create a win-win situation where customers are incentivized to provide feedback in exchange for loyalty points.

This integration helps increase survey response rates significantly, as customers see immediate value in participating. The automated nature of the integration means you don't need to manually track survey completions or award points, saving time while ensuring consistent reward distribution. Additionally, the points earned from surveys can drive customers back to your store to redeem their rewards, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits both customer satisfaction and business growth.
