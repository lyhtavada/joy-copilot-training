Q: What is Joy And Judge Me in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Joy And Judge Me work?
Q: How do I connect Joy And Judge Me with Joy Loyalty?
A: This feature is available for All plans.

### Understanding the rules

The rules for the integration between Joy and Judgeme are quite simple:

When a customer leaves a review through the Judgeme review widget, then the merchant approves the review from the backend, once done, the customer earns points in the Joy Loyalty Program.

You need to be on the Judge.me's Awesome plan and above is to connect from Joy to Judge.me because only with that Judge.me only allows API access.

### Setup the integration

1

Go to `Integrations > Judgeme` to find the integration page

2

`Connect` on step 2, and select `Authorize` to confirm the integration process

3

**Select Jugdeme in the Review apps**

Head to the Joy review program, choose Judgeme as the targeted review target

Remember to set a limit for the amount of reviews a customer can give to prevent them from exploiting the system

4

**Test the program**

Visit the `Activities > Review activities > View all reviews activities` to see all the pending rewards transactions for the reviews

Customers won't see their balance updated until the reward is approved, preventing abuse of points through reviews
