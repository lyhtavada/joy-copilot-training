Q: What is Recharge Subscription in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How do I set up Recharge Subscription?
Q: How do I connect Recharge Subscription with Joy Loyalty?
A: This feature is available in **All** plans

### What is the [Recharge](https://getrecharge.com/) Integration

The Recharge Integration provides two key functionalities for subscription-based stores:

1. **Discount Code Synchronization**: Automatically syncs Joy Loyalty discount codes to Recharge, allowing customers to apply loyalty discounts to their subscription orders through the Recharge customer portal.
2. **Subscription Rewards**: Allows merchants to reward customers with loyalty points for subscription purchases and renewals, encouraging long-term subscription retention.

This integration ensures that customers receive loyalty rewards for their recurring subscription orders and can use their earned loyalty discounts on both one-time purchases and subscription orders seamlessly.

### Why do you need this feature?

The Recharge Integration creates a unified loyalty experience for your subscription customers, offering both rewards for subscription purchases and the ability to use loyalty discounts on recurring orders. Without this integration, subscription customers would be disconnected from your loyalty program benefits, missing out on earning and redeeming rewards for their most valuable purchases.

Enabling this integration creates a complete loyalty ecosystem where subscription customers can earn points for their recurring orders and apply their earned discounts seamlessly through the Recharge customer portal. This comprehensive approach significantly increases customer lifetime value, as subscription customers typically represent your most loyal segment and highest revenue potential.

### How the integration works

#### Discount code synchronization

When a customer redeems loyalty points for a discount code:

1. **Discount Creation**: Joy creates the discount code as usual
2. **Sync to Recharge**: The system automatically syncs applicable discounts to Recharge
3. **Customer Access**: Customers can apply the discount in the Recharge customer portal
4. **Automatic Management**: The system manages discount lifecycle (activation, deactivation, deletion)

#### Subscription rewards

When customers place subscription orders:

1. **Order Processing**: Recharge processes the subscription order
2. **Point Calculation**: Joy calculates loyalty points based on your configured rules
3. **Point Award**: Points are automatically added to the customer's loyalty account
4. **Notification**: Customers can be notified of their earned points (if email notifications are enabled)
