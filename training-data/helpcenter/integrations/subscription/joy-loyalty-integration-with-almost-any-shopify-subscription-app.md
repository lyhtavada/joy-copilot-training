Q: What is Joy Loyalty Integration With Almost Any Shopify Subscription App in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Joy Loyalty Integration With Almost Any Shopify Subscription App work?
Q: How do I connect Joy Loyalty Integration With Almost Any Shopify Subscription App with Joy Loyalty?
A: ### Introduction

Two of the most common use cases when integrating **Joy Loyalty** with a **subscription app** are:

1. **Rewarding customers for subscription orders**
2. **Allowing customers to redeem coupons for their subscription cycles**

Both use cases work out of the box with most subscription apps that use [**Shopify Selling Plans**](https://www.shopify.com/blog/sales-planning) **and Contracts** — the standard set by [Shopify’s own Subscription app](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions). If your subscription app follows this standard, Joy will work seamlessly with it.

#### Supported subscription apps (tested)

You can find the list of officially supported integrations on the **Integration** page inside our app.
For these apps, make sure you’ve set up your **selling plans** and **subscription products** before continuing.

#### Setting up rewards for subscription orders

To start rewarding points for subscription orders:

1. Go to **Rewards programs,** you can create or edit the default subscription order program
2. Ensure your subscription app and selling plans are already installed and active.
3. Click **“I have a subscription app & plan”** to confirm setup.
4. Configure the reward conditions just like any other earning rule — set how many points customers earn, define eligible conditions, and save the program.

Once complete, activate the program and place a test subscription order to confirm points are being earned correctly.

Once done, you can turn on the program and test if the subscription orders are earning or not.

#### Set up the discount redemption for the subscription

To let customers redeem points for subscription discounts:

1. Create a new **Redeeming program**.
2. Under **Purchase type**, choose whether the discount applies to:

   - **Both** one-time and subscription purchases, or
   - **Each separately** (recommended: create different programs for each type).
3. In the **Conditions** section, enable the option **“Recurring payments for subscriptions”** if you want the discount to apply to multiple cycles.

> 💡 Most merchants choose to let coupons apply to **only one cycle** to avoid ongoing discounts for the same redemption.

Once a customer redeems a coupon, each of their active subscriptions will have its own **subscription management page**. You can visit each page and apply the coupon to the corresponding subscription as needed.

#### FAQs

**1. Do I need a specific subscription app for this integration?**
No. Joy works with most subscription apps that follow Shopify’s **Selling Plans and Contracts** standard. Popular options like Recharge, Appstle, and Seal Subscriptions are supported out of the box. But if it is an outdated app with no Shopify Selling Plan, sorry, it is a no.
