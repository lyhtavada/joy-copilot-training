This privacy policy outlines how **Avada Commerce, Inc.** ("Avada", “we” or “us”) handle information from **End Users** ("you") of our website and the information we collect for clients using our services.

Avada participates in and complies with the **EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework** and the Swiss**-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework**.

We maintain this responsibility unless we can prove we're not responsible for any event causing damage to data protection.

This policy applies only to services directly under Avada's control. Third-party services operate independently, and we are not responsible for their privacy practices. Note that additional service agreements may take precedence over this policy where differences exist.
