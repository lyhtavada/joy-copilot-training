Q: What is Logged Out But Coupons Still Applied in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Logged Out But Coupons Still Applied work?
A: When a customer logs out of the account after applying the discount code redeemed from our app, and you may find that the coupon is still applied. Perhaps we have set the redeeming program condition of "Who can use discount" to Everyone. So, if redeemed,the coupon can be used by anyone, even anonymously.

However, if you want to make sure that this coupon should be removed, then you should use this configuration as "Only customer who redeemed" to prevent misuse.
