Q: What is Does Manual Point Adjusting Affect VIP Tier Status in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Does Manual Point Adjusting Affect VIP Tier Status work?
A: By default, adjusting a customer's points does not affect their tier status. The customer's tier will only change according to the settings in the [VIP Tier](https://help.joy.so/membership/vip-tiers#how-to-set-up-vip-tiers-feature) or if you manually adjust the tier on the customer's detailed information page.

However, if you tick this option, you can allow manually-adjusted points to affect the milestone and VIP tier. Only use this option if you are really sure of your program setting.
