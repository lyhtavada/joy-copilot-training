Q: Why is The Complete Joy Loyalty Onboarding Guide not working?
A: In today's competitive e-commerce landscape, customer loyalty has become more valuable than ever. With the rising costs of customer acquisition and the limitations of *third-party tracking*, nurturing your existing customer relationships is essential for sustainable growth. Joy Loyalty offers a powerful solution to this challenge, providing a comprehensive loyalty program that can significantly increase customer retention, purchase frequency, and lifetime value.

This guidebook will walk you through the process of setting up and optimizing your Joy Loyalty program, ensuring you create an experience that resonates with your customers and delivers measurable business results. We'll cover everything from initial configuration to advanced optimization strategies, helping you transform casual shoppers into dedicated brand advocates.

### Why invest time in proper setup?

The success of your loyalty program depends largely on thoughtful implementation. While it might be tempting to rush through the setup to get your program live quickly, taking the time to configure each element properly will yield significantly better results in the long run.

A well-designed loyalty program directly impacts these metrics by creating compelling reasons for customers to return to your store repeatedly.

Beyond immediate sales impact, your loyalty program also serves as a valuable data collection tool. In an era where third-party cookies are being phased out, the zero-party data you gather through your loyalty program becomes increasingly precious for personalization and marketing efforts.

Let's build a loyalty program that doesn't just exist as a feature checkbox but delivers genuine business value through stronger customer relationships.

### Essential setup steps

### 1. Enable Customer accounts

[Customer accounts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts) are the foundation of your loyalty program, allowing you to track points, redemptions, and customer activity across sessions and devices. Without properly configured customer accounts, your loyalty program won't function effectively.

Navigate to your Shopify admin panel and go to Settings → [Customer accounts](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/customers/customer-accounts). Here, you'll need to choose between legacy accounts (traditional email/password login) and new customer accounts (email link login). This decision will impact how customers interact with your loyalty program.

#### **Understanding your options: Legacy vs. New Customer accounts**

Your choice between Shopify's two account systems will significantly impact how your loyalty program appears and functions for customers. Consider these differences carefully:

Legacy Customer Account

New Customer Account
