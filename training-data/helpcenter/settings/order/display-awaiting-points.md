### What is this feature

The "Log activity for orders with pending points" feature creates instant activity logs when customers place orders, showing them exactly how many points they'll earn once the order is fulfilled. This feature bridges the gap between order placement and fulfillment by providing immediate transparency about loyalty rewards.

### Why users should use this feature

This feature significantly improves the customer experience by providing immediate gratification and transparency. When customers place an order, they instantly see their expected point earnings logged in their activity history, even though the points haven't been officially awarded yet.

### How to enable and configure this feature

#### Accessing the setting

1

Navigate to your Joy admin panel

2

Go to **Settings**

3

Select **Order** from the left menu

#### Understanding the configuration

When you enable "Display awaiting points," Joy will automatically create activity logs for every new order placed by customers. These logs will appear in multiple locations throughout your loyalty system:

- Loyalty widget: My history section
- Loyalty blocks: Loyalty dashboard block
- Customer account: Loyalty dashboard block

### FAQs

**Q: Will customers receive the points immediately when they place an order?** A: No, customers will only see that they have earned points pending fulfillment. The actual points are awarded according to your existing order status rules (typically when marked as "fulfilled").

**Q: What happens if an order is cancelled or refunded?** A: The pending activity log will be updated to reflect the cancellation or refund, and no points will be awarded. If points were already awarded, they will be deducted according to your refund settings.

**Q: Can customers redeem pending points?** A: No, pending points cannot be redeemed until the order is actually fulfilled and the points are officially awarded to the customer's account.

**Q: Does this feature work with all order statuses?** A: This feature specifically works with the "fulfilled" order status setting. The activity log is created immediately upon order placement, but points are still awarded based on your configured order status rules.

**Q: Will this feature affect my existing point earning rules?** A: No, this feature only adds visibility to the point earning process. Your existing rules for when points are actually awarded remain unchanged.

**Q: What if I have complex earning rules with different point values?** A: The system will calculate and display the expected points based on all your current earning rules, including product-specific multipliers, customer tier bonuses, and promotional campaigns.
