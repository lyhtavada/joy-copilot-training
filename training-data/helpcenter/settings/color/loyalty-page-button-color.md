Q: What is Loyalty Page Button Color in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Loyalty Page Button Color work?
Q: Where can I find Loyalty Page Button Color settings?
A: This feature is available for: **All** plans

### What is this feature

The Joy Loyalty button color customization feature allows you to set global color variables for all buttons across your loyalty page. Instead of having to edit button colors individually in each section, you can now set primary, secondary, and disabled button colors in one central location. These color settings automatically apply to all buttons throughout your loyalty program, ensuring visual consistency and brand alignment.

### Why use this feature

Consistent button colors across your loyalty program create a more professional, cohesive customer experience. By maintaining your brand identity throughout the customer journey, you establish stronger recognition and trust with your audience. This feature saves you valuable time by allowing you to update all button colors in one central location instead of tediously modifying each section individually. With global button color settings, you can ensure your loyalty program feels like an integrated extension of your brand rather than a disconnected third-party element.

There are two ways to access the global button color settings in Joy Loyalty:

#### Method 1: From the Embedded Content menu

5. A new tab will open with the global button color settings

#### Configuring button colors

On the settings page, you'll see the following customization options:

1. **Primary button color**: The main color for call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Sign up", "Claim reward")
2. **Primary button text color**: The text color that appears on primary buttons
3. **Secondary button color**: The color for secondary action buttons
4. **Secondary button text color**: The text color that appears on secondary buttons
5. **Disabled button color**: The color for buttons that are not currently active

To customize a color:
