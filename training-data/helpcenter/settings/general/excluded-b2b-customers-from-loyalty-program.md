Q: What is Excluded B2B Customers From Loyalty Program in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Excluded B2B Customers From Loyalty Program work?
Q: Where can I find Excluded B2B Customers From Loyalty Program settings?
A: This feature is available for **Enterprise plan**

### What is this feature

The B2B customer exclusion feature in Joy Loyalty automatically prevents customers marked as B2B in Shopify from participating in your loyalty program. When a customer is designated as a B2B customer through Shopify's company management, Joy Loyalty will prevent them from:

- check

  Joining your loyalty program
- check

  Earning points on purchases
- check

  Redeeming points for rewards
- check

  Accessing tier-based privileges (if you have VIP tiers enabled)

This ensures your loyalty program remains focused on retail customers while maintaining separate pricing and discount structures for your business customers.

### Requirements before using this feature

To use the B2B exclusion feature, you need:

1. A Shopify Plus store subscription
2. The Joy Loyalty app installed
3. At least one B2B customer assigned to a company in your Shopify admin

### Why use this feature

B2B customers typically receive special pricing, bulk discounts, or customized contractual terms. Including these customers in your loyalty program could potentially:

- Allow B2B customers to stack loyalty discounts on top of negotiated B2B pricing
- Create pricing inconsistencies in your business model
- Impact your store's revenue and profit margins
- Create confusion between B2B and DTC purchasing processes

By excluding B2B customers, you maintain clear separation between your loyalty program for individual shoppers and your business customer relationships.

### Setting up B2B customer exclusion

Configuring this feature requires setting your customer eligibility preferences and optionally syncing customer data to ensure all B2B designations are current.

1

**Choose your customer eligibility setting**

- From your Shopify admin, navigate to **Apps** > **Joy Loyalty**
- In the left sidebar, click on **Settings**
- Select the **General** tab
- Find the **Customer Eligibility** section
- You'll see two options:

  - **All customers**: Both direct-to-consumer (DTC) and business-to-business (B2B) customers will be eligible for the loyalty program
  - **Only DTC customers**: Exclude B2B customers from the loyalty program. Only direct-to-consumer customers will earn and redeem points
- Select **Only DTC customers** to activate the B2B exclusion feature
- Click **Save changes**

2

**Sync customer B2B status**

To ensure Joy Loyalty has the most current information about which customers are part of B2B companies:

1. In the **Customer Eligibility** section, look for the **Sync customer data** area
2. Click **Sync now** to update the B2B status and company information for all customers
3. The system will display when the last sync occurred and how many customers were updated

Q: Will enabling this feature affect my existing DTC customers?
A: No, enabling B2B customer exclusion will only impact customers who are assigned to a company in Shopify. All your direct-to-consumer customers will continue to participate in your loyalty program as usual.

Q: What happens if a customer was in my loyalty program and then gets added to a B2B company?
A: Once a customer is added to a B2B company and you've selected "Only DTC customers," they will no longer be able to earn or redeem points. Their loyalty status will be suspended as long as they remain a B2B customer.

Q: Can a B2B customer still see previous orders they placed as an individual?
A: According to Shopify's B2B functionality, after a customer is added to a company, they can no longer view their previous individual orders on your website.

Q: Will this feature impact my draft orders?
A: When you create draft orders for B2B customers, these orders will not earn loyalty points once the feature is enabled.

Q: How often should I sync B2B customer data?
A: The system will sync periodically, but we recommend manually syncing after making significant changes to your B2B customer assignments in Shopify.
