With our Joy app, you can easily add this functionality to your Shopify POS grid, streamlining operations and improving the customer experience.

Customers can choose between two versions of the Joy widget for Shopify POS: Joy Loyalty POS Extension and Joy: Loyalty program (Legacy).

1. **New Version (Joy Loyalty POS Extension)**: Launched in 2024, leveraging the [Shopify POS UI extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/pos-ui-extensions), this version enhances the POS interface with features like a modal for customer redemptions, inputs for greater flexibility, and the ability to see the member's status and name. It allows customers to redeem free products, locate existing coupons, and manage their loyalty details more effectively.

1. **Previous Version (Joy: Loyalty Program)**: This legacy version is now deprecated. Initially, it displayed the balance and basic member information directly in the grid and allowed for redeeming discounts and percentages with fixed presets. Due to advancements in technology and customer feedback, we recommend migrating to the latest version for improved functionality and support.
