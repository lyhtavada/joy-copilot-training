Q: What is Translations in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How do I set up Translations?
Q: Why is Translations not working?
A: - **Editing English content** is available in the **Free plan**.
- **Changing the default language** and **editing content in the default language** require the **Professional plan**.
- **Using the Detect Language feature** is available only in the **Advanced and Enterprise plans**.

### Understanding the Rule

Joy's translation feature operates through two main tabs:

1. **Default Language**: This is the language in which the widget will be displayed if no other language is detected.
2. **Detected Language**: This language is identified based on the user's information. There are two methods for detecting the language:

   - **Customer's IP**: Detects the language based on the customer's geographical location.
   - **Browser's Language**: Detects the language set in the customer's browser settings.
   - **Shopify language selector**: Auto-translate pages corresponding to the language selected on a multi-language store

Find [detailed instructions](/translations#translate-with-shopify-language-selector) for the advanced translation option - Shopify language selector

With Joy Loyalty's Translations, you can change the language of the widget to suit your customers' preferences. The supported languages include:

**Note:** After translating your loyalty program to your new language, you can still customize the content title in a more specialized manner to suit your objectives

The **default language** refers to the language in which the widget is displayed.

- In the **Free plan**, the default language is always **English**, and you can make basic content edits.
- Starting from the **Professional plan**, merchants can change the default language and modify all content in that language.

To change the default language:

1

Go to **Translations**

2

**Select the language** you want to set as the default in the widget

### How to set up the **detected language**

The Detected Language feature allows the widget to display content in the user's preferred language. This preference is determined based on:

- The user's IP address
- The language settings of the user's browser

#### **Translate with Shopify language selector**

This option allows a seamless translation option that aligns with the customer's selected language on multi-language stores.

Merchants can combine the [Shopify language selector](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/international/localization-and-translation) with the Joy translation settings for a comprehensive on-site translation.

#### Set Up Detected Language:

1

Go to **Translations**

2

Choose how to detect your customer's language

3

Add **Detected Languages** and edit the list by selecting the languages you want to support
