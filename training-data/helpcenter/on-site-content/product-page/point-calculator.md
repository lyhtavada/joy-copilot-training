### Introduction

The Point Calculator is your secret weapon for turning every purchase into an exciting rewards journey. It's like a digital scoreboard that shows customers exactly how many points they'll earn, transforming shopping from a transaction into a rewarding experience.

In today’s competitive e-commerce market, driving repeat purchases and customer loyalty is essential. The Point Calculator feature in our Joy Loyalty App does more than just track rewards—it motivates customers to make purchases by showing how many points they can earn with each order. This encourages immediate buying and helps build long-term loyalty, making it a crucial tool for boosting repeat sales and engagement.

### How to set up the point calculator

Open **Point calculator setting**

- On the left menu of Joy, go to **Branding > Point calculator > Setup**.

Set **the position of the Point calculator** in the theme settings

- Click on "**Go to theme**", you will be directed to the Shopify theme settings page.

- At this point, **select any product > open its product details page**. In the image, I have chosen "3 Decorative Glass Vases Set."

- On the left sidebar, in the template settings, **Add block > Apps > Joy: Point calculator**.

- After completing the setup, the Point calculator will be displayed as shown in the image below. If you are satisfied with the design and position, click **Save**. You have successfully added the Point calculator to your store.

### How to set up point calculation display on the Cart page

In addition to the default display on the product detail page, the point calculator block can also **be shown on the cart page**. To enable this feature, `activate "Also use on Cart Page"` and then go to the theme settings to add the Point Calculator to the cart page. Adding the Point calculator to the cart page is similar to adding this feature to the product detail page.
