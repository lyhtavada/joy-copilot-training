Q: What is Redeem In Cart Drawer in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Redeem In Cart Drawer work?
Q: How do I customize Redeem In Cart Drawer on my store?
A: This feature is available in **Pro, Advanced, Enterprise plans**

### What is this feature?

Picture your customer with $150 of skincare products in their cart and 800 loyalty points. Instead of forcing them to navigate away and risk losing their shopping momentum, the Cart Drawer Redeem Block lets them redeem points instantly within their cart.

They see "Redeem your points: 800 points," select "$25 off for every 250 points," and watch their total drop to $100 in one click: no disruption, no confusion – just seamless value recognition embedded directly in their purchase flow.

### Why you should use this feature

Rising acquisition costs demand maximizing existing customer relationships over chasing new ones. Every redemption friction point represents lost revenue and weakened loyalty.

The Cart Drawer Redeem Block creates immediate gratification that builds psychological loyalty. When customers redeem points without disrupting their flow, they develop anticipation for future redemptions, shifting from price-shopping to loyalty-building.
