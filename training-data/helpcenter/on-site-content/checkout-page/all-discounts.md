Q: How do I customize All Discounts on my store?
A: This feature is available for the **Enterprise** plan and Shopify Plus for [Checkout Extensibility](https://www.shopify.com/plus/upgrading-to-checkout-extensibility)

### What is the All Discounts View Block

The All Discounts View block is a Shopify UI extension that displays a comprehensive list or grid of all available discount rewards in your loyalty program. Unlike other blocks that may show limited rewards, this block provides customers with a complete overview of all discount opportunities they can earn through your loyalty program.

### Why you should use the All Discounts View Block

The All Discounts View block serves as a powerful motivation tool by showing customers the full range of savings available through your loyalty program. When customers see all possible discounts in one place, they're more likely to engage with the program and work toward higher-value rewards.

This block is particularly effective for driving program enrollment, as prospective members can see the complete value proposition of joining your loyalty program. It also helps existing members discover rewards they might not have known about, increasing overall program engagement and redemption rates.
