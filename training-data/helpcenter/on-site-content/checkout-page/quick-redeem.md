### What is the Quick Redeem Block

The Quick Redeem block is a streamlined Shopify UI extension that provides customers with instant access to their most relevant loyalty rewards. This compact block focuses on immediate redemption opportunities, showing only the rewards customers can currently afford with their point balance, making the redemption process fast and friction-free.

### Why you should use the Quick Redeem Block

The Quick Redeem block removes barriers to reward redemption by presenting only actionable options to customers. Instead of overwhelming them with all available rewards, it focuses on what they can immediately claim, leading to higher conversion rates and increased customer satisfaction.

This block is particularly effective for increasing impulse redemptions and can be strategically placed throughout your store to capture moments when customers are most likely to redeem rewards, such as during checkout or after adding items to their cart.

### How to set up

1

Click "**Reward programs**" in the navigation bar, then choose "**Redeem programs**". Choose any discount program.

2

Enable the "**Redeem at checkout page**" feature in the Redeem value section

**Operation Mechanism:**

Customers can redeem points directly at checkout, converting them into a temporary discount code. If they complete the purchase, the code is applied. If they change their mind, they can cancel it, and the points will be refunded instantly.
