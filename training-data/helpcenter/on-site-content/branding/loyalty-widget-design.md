### Overview

The first key to a successful loyalty program is **visibility**. Customers need to see and access it easily if you want them to engage. That’s where your **loyalty widget** comes in—it makes your program instantly available during the shopping journey.

The widget design is important because it provides a **seamless, easy-to-access way** for customers to interact with your program directly on your website. It allows them to quickly check their points, rewards, and progress without leaving their shopping flow. A well-designed widget not only fits your brand’s style but also enhances the overall user experience, drives engagement, and encourages participation—ultimately boosting customer retention.

With Joy, you can customize the widget to reflect your colors, fonts, and tone, giving your loyalty program both **visibility and a professional, branded look** that feels like a natural extension of your store.

### Before we start

#### Preview mode

It is highly recommended that you have a duplicate theme on your store by using the Shopify duplicate feature. This might take a while, depending on how large your theme size is.

Then you can enable the Widget's App Embeds and hit the save button.

Later on, you can use the Preview feature of Shopify to see the widget on the storefront without affecting live customers.

#### Brand colors

Joy automatically detects your store’s brand palette directly from your store. You’ll see your **primary, secondary, and accent colors** ready to go in `Settings > Colors`.

- Click the **color picker** of the color name to update your widget’s main tone.
- These colors are suggested directly from your brand, so your widget naturally fits your storefront design.

This ensures your widget doesn’t just stand out—it feels like it belongs.

Also, these brand colors, along with the color history, are available in the color picker throughout the app, which you can easily reuse and mention.

### Step 1: Open the widget design settings

From your Joy dashboard, you can go to On-site content > Branding > Widget Design. On this page, you can change widget color and style, where and how it displays, and even advanced settings like custom CSS.

### Step 2: Adjust the layout

Under the Widget theme section, you can choose to have your Display type as a floating widget or a drawer. With the floating widget, it will take a small space on your storefront like a chatbox; meanwhile, the drawer can look like your cart drawer. If you already have a cart drawer, you may find this layout fits seamlessly with your current shopping experience.
