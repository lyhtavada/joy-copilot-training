### Why this update matters

#### The value behind the pricing

Over the past year, Joy added major capabilities including **paid membership store credits, social engagement rewards, advanced integrations** (Recharge, Klaviyo, Shopify Flow), **advanced POS integration, enhanced VIP tiers, and loyalty AI agent**. The new pricing reflects this enhanced value while keeping Joy competitive in the loyalty platform market.

#### How this affects you

- **Existing subscribers:** Your rate doesn't change — you keep your current price permanently as a thank you for being an early supporter
- **New subscribers:** Access all the latest features at the updated pricing
- **All merchants:** No reduction in features or support quality

### Understanding grandfathered pricing

**Grandfathered pricing** means your subscription rate stays locked at the price you originally signed up for, regardless of future pricing updates.

#### How it works

If you subscribed to Joy Loyalty **before February 9****th** **2026**, you belong to one of two cohorts with special pricing protection:

**Cohort 1: Subscribed before September 2025 (Oldest cohort)**

**Your protection:**

- ✅ Keep your rate permanently — even if you downgrade to Free plan
- ✅ Upgrade to higher plans at legacy rates
- ❌ Lose protection **only if you uninstall** the app

> **Example:** You started on Essential at $24.90/month. You can upgrade to Advanced ($99, not $129) or downgrade to Free and come back to Essential at $24.90 anytime — as long as you don't uninstall.

**Cohort 2: Subscribed between September 2025 - February 8****th** **2026 (Middle cohort)**

**Your protection:**

- ✅ Keep your rate as long as you stay on or above your **starting plan**

#### What is the starting plan?

The starting plan is the very first plan you are on, right after this new pricing takes effect.

- ✅ Upgrade to higher plans at legacy rates
- ⚠️ Lose protection if you downgrade **below your starting plan**
- ❌ Lose protection if you uninstall the app
