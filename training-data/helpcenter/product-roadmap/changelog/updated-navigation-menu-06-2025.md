Q: What is Updated Navigation Menu 06 2025 in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Updated Navigation Menu 06 2025 work?
A: ### What is this update

The updated navigation menu is a streamlined interface that consolidates Joy's features into 7 main menu items instead of the previous expanded structure. This reorganization improves user experience by reducing menu clutter and grouping related functionalities together in logical sections.

The new menu structure eliminates the need for a "see more" option by strategically moving certain features into more appropriate parent sections. This change makes it easier for merchants to find the tools they need while maintaining quick access to all Joy features.

**Q: Can I still access all the same features as before?** A: Yes, all features remain available. They've simply been moved to more logical locations within the menu structure. No functionality has been removed or changed.

**Q: Do I need to update any integrations or embedded widgets?** A: No, this is purely an admin interface change. Your customer-facing loyalty program and any integrations will continue to work exactly as before.

**Q: What if I can't find a specific feature?** A: Refer to the menu reorganization guide above, or use the search function if available in your dashboard. The main relocations are: customer activities moved to Customers section, and subscription/translation/notification settings moved to Settings.

**Q: Will my team need retraining on the new menu?** A: The changes are designed to be intuitive, but you may want to share this guide with team members who regularly use the Joy dashboard. The logical grouping should actually make features easier to find.

**Q: Can I switch back to the old menu layout?** A: No, the updated menu structure is now the standard interface for all Joy users. However, the improved organization should provide a better user experience once you're familiar with the new layout.
