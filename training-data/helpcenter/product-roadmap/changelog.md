Q: What is Changelog in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Changelog work?
A: ## Changelog

Joy loyalty program changelog for merchants who want a regularly updated product. We think that constant development and improvement is the way to achieve an excellent result.

### [1.192] - 2026-01

#### Instagram Comment Rewards

Merchants in fashion and lifestyle need organic social engagement to boost brand awareness. Running ads is expensive with diminishing returns. Now customers can earn points by commenting on Instagram posts - creating natural interaction that helps posts go viral. Includes keyword filtering to reward specific answers or avoid spam, plus auto-reply and DM notifications to acknowledge engagement.

#### Membership Subscription via Joy Subscription (Native Integration)

Setting up membership previously required complex Shopify Flow configuration with poor UX. Native integration with Joy Subscription enables "plug-and-play" setup, increasing cross-app adoption within the Avada ecosystem. Customers who purchase subscription plans automatically enter VIP tiers and receive benefits, building a tighter recurring revenue and loyalty loop. Two-way sync between apps.[[1]](https://avadaio.slack.com/archives/C07RNAY9ZC6/p1770001420653769)

#### Loyalty Note

Ideas pop up while setting up programs - a campaign to launch, a widget tweak to make. Instead of switching to external tools, merchants now have a built-in notebook with rich text and todo lists right inside Joy.

#### Submit Receipt Program

Not all purchases happen online. Customers shopping at physical locations or partner stores can now submit receipts to earn points, helping merchants reward and convert offline customers into loyal program members.
