Q: What is Manage Customers Types in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Manage Customers Types work?
A: This feature is available for **All** plans.

### Overview

Customer types are one of the foundations of how Joy Loyalty works. They determine who can earn points, who can redeem rewards, and who can actually see their loyalty status. Understanding how customers move between these types—and how Shopify’s account system affects them—helps you run a loyalty program that is consistent, fair, and aligned with your store setup.

### Why customer types matter

Every customer interacts with your store differently. Some authenticate through Shopify’s modern SSO, some still use legacy customer accounts, and others simply check out as guests. Joy translates these behaviors into clear customer types so the loyalty experience always stays consistent.

- **Members** can earn points, redeem rewards, and see their full loyalty status inside the widget.
- **Guests** may earn points if allowed, but they cannot redeem or view their loyalty balance until they register.
- **Left-program customers** are fully excluded and do not see the loyalty widget at all.

This structure ensures your loyalty program behaves exactly as you intend, no matter how customers choose to shop.

### The three customer types in Joy Loyalty

#### **Member**

A Member is a fully eligible customer who can earn points, redeem rewards, join VIP tiers, and see their loyalty status inside the widget. Members have access to the complete loyalty experience.

How someone becomes a Member depends on your Shopify account system, which Joy automatically detects.

You can also let all as guest, and choose to manually assign who can be accessible to the program.

#### **Guest**

A Guest is a customer who is not recognized as a Member. They may earn points if guest earning is enabled, but they cannot redeem rewards or view their loyalty data until they become Members. The widget only displays general program information to them.

#### **Left program**

Customers in this type are completely excluded from the loyalty program. They cannot earn points, cannot redeem, and cannot view the loyalty widget at all. Stores often use this type for wholesale users, internal staff, test accounts, or any customers who should be excluded from rewards.

### SSO vs legacy accounts: how customers become Members

Joy follows Shopify’s authentication rules to determine the customer type.

#### If your store uses Shopify’s SSO (New Customer Accounts)

With SSO, customers authenticate using Shopify’s identity system instead of creating a traditional store account. Once authenticated:

- Joy always treats them as a **Member**
- They do not need to register a store account
- Their loyalty status appears instantly
- They can earn and redeem seamlessly

**With SSO, customers are Members anytime Shopify identifies them.**
