Q: What is Customer Management in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How do I set up Customer Management?
Q: Why is Customer Management not working?
A: This feature is available for **All** plans.

### Overview

A loyalty program is never “set and forget.” Even when your earning rules, VIP tiers, and rewards are already in place, customers will still need attention — missing points, checkout as guests, lost coupons, unclear tier progress, or sync issues with Shopify and marketing tools.

These moments happen often, and when they do, the **Customer Management** page becomes the place you rely on the most. This is where you understand what happened with a specific customer and take the right action to support them.

Because of that, we focus on helping you navigate this page well. Customer Management is the hub where you handle almost everything after your loyalty program goes live — the real, ongoing work of keeping data correct and supporting your members.

We constantly update this page to make sure that what you need to find, is there.

### Why we highlight this page

After setup, the loyalty program continues through your customers’ real behavior: placing orders, making returns, redeeming rewards, creating coupons, referring friends, or unsubscribing from emails. Most questions or issues merchants face come from these everyday actions.

Customer Management gives you a complete view of each customer. It helps you check whether everything is properly synced, whether their points were calculated correctly, and whether referrals or rewards happened as expected. It’s where you get clarity before making any changes.

### How to set up and use Customer Management

#### **Access Customer Management**

Open **Joy → Customers** from your Shopify admin sidebar.
This brings you to the customer grid — the overview of all customers who have interacted with your loyalty program.

#### **On customer grid**

The customer grid gives you a fast, high-level understanding of your loyalty audience. Instead of opening each customer profile, you can quickly assess their current loyalty status from here. It is especially useful for support conversations, audits, or when you want to review VIP tiers or point balances at scale.

The grid displays:

- **Customer name and email** – their identity
- **Membership type** – Member, Guest, or Left
- **Points** – current active balance
- **VIP tier** – the tier they belong to
- **VIP point** – amount that contributed toward their tier, can be point amount or spent amount.
- **Birthday -** Customer birthday
- **Last updated** – the last time loyalty data was synced

You can search by name or email, filter by segments or tiers, and quickly click into any customer profile for deeper investigation.

#### **Open an individual customer profile**

Click on any customer in the grid to open their full loyalty profile.
