Q: What is Automated Customer Email Notifications in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How do I set up Automated Customer Email Notifications?
A: ## Overview

A successful loyalty program isn’t just about earning points and rewards—it’s also about **visibility**. Customers need to see and remember your program if you want them to use it. The widget gives them in-store access, but notifications extend that visibility beyond your site.

That’s where **automated notifications** come in. They deliver timely reminders straight to customers’ inboxes—letting them know when they’ve earned points, reminding them of unused rewards, or celebrating milestones like birthdays. This keeps your program visible, personal, and hard to forget.

## Why notifications matter

Think of notifications as gentle nudges that **make your program visible outside your storefront**. They keep loyalty top of mind and encourage customers to come back, redeem, or engage further. A well-timed email can turn a one-time shopper into a repeat buyer.

Notifications also build **transparency and trust**. Customers don’t need to worry about forgetting a coupon code or missing a reward in the widget. For example, if someone signs up and forgets to copy their welcome coupon, they can always find it again in their email. This reduces support questions and makes your program feel more reliable.

To make sure you don’t overwhelm or spam your customers, notifications in Joy are **off by default**. You’re in control of which ones to activate. The idea is simple: only send messages that truly matter—like reward coupons, referral confirmations, or reminders about expiring points. This way, every email feels important and valuable.

## Where notifications apply

Notifications aren’t one-size-fits-all. They apply across different parts of your program:

- **Reward programs**: Earn points, redeem points, birthday rewards, and POS point redemption.
- **Referral programs**: Send coupons to both referrers and their friends.
- **VIP tiers**: Notify customers when they unlock or move up to a new VIP status.
- **Points expiry**: Remind customers when their points are about to expire.

Each notification type serves a different purpose, but together they keep customers engaged at every stage of their journey.
