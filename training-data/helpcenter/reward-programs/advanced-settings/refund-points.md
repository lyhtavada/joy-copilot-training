- **Customer Redeems Points**: The customer redeems points for a coupon.
- **Coupon Applied and Purchase Made**: The customer applies the coupon and completes the purchase.

### Precise Point Calculation for Partial Refunds

The system features advanced point revocation that accurately handles partial refunds on a per-item basis. When only specific items from an order are refunded, the system automatically calculates the exact proportion of points that should be returned to the customer.

This precise calculation ensures that customers receive fair point refunds that correspond exactly to the items being returned, rather than losing all points from an order when only partial items are refunded. The feature maintains accurate point balance management across all refund scenarios, whether full or partial.

### Important note

Refunding Points only applies to fully canceled orders. If an order is partially canceled, points used for the removed items will not be refunded.
