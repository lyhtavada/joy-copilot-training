Q: How do customers earn rewards with Discount Combination?
A: This feature is available for: **Professional, Advanced and Enterprise** plans.

### How Discount combinations work

Allow customers to stack eligible discounts for the best total discount, combining both automatic discounts and discount codes.

Each discount that you create belongs to one of the following categories, depending on what the discount applies to:

- Order discount
- Product discount
- Shipping discount

You can choose which discount categories combine. For example, a 10% order discount code can be combined with product discount codes.

If a customer enters more than one discount code during checkout that can't be combined, they'll see this message: "Discount couldn't be used with your existing discounts.

### Discount combination limit

#### **Only 1 discount per product**[**​**](https://help.avada.app/joy/use-multiple-discount-codes/#only-1-discount-per-product)

If your customer applies 2 product discounts on the same product, Shopify will automatically select the most beneficial discount for your customer.

#### **Only 1 shipping discount per order**[**​**](https://help.avada.app/joy/use-multiple-discount-codes/#only-1-shipping-discount-per-order)

Please note that your customers can only apply one shipping discount per order. This ensures fair use and maintains the integrity of your discount system.

#### I changed the Discount combination setting. Will it affect a previously redeemed discount?

No, it will not. I can only be applied the newly redeemed discount after the setting change.
