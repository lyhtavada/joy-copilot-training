Q: Can customers see when they'll be eligible for a birthday reward?
A: Yes, customers can see a countdown in the loyalty widget showing when they'll be eligible for their birthday reward.

Q: What happens if a customer enters their birthday less than 30 days before their actual birth date?
A: For anti-fraud purposes, customers must enter their birth date at least 30 days before their birthday to receive the reward.

Q: If I change the when to reward setting from "Exact birthday date" to "Calendar month of birthday", when will the notification be sent - on the first day of the month or on the actual birthday?
A: When you select "Calendar month of birthday", the system will send the notification on the first day of the birth month (1st of the month) rather than on the specific birthday date. This allows customers to have the entire month to use their birthday reward.

Examples:

- If a customer's birthday is March 15th, with "Calendar month of birthday" setting, the notification will be sent on March 1st

Q: Can I change the number of points given for birthday rewards?
A: Yes, you can customize the point value for birthday rewards in the program settings.

Q: Do customers need to have an account to receive birthday rewards?
A: Yes, customers need to be registered in your loyalty program and provide their birth date to be eligible for birthday rewards.

Q: Can I offer different types of rewards besides points?
A: Currently, birthday rewards are given as pointscan be redeemed for rewards, or as discounts that

Q: Can I set up different birthday rewards for different VIP tiers?
A: Yes, it is possible. But it is possible on the **Advanced** plan with the [Rule engine](/reward-programs/rule-engine-multiple-program-system) turned on. With the advanced rule engine, you are allowed to reward the birthday program differently for each tier. As in the image below, you can have Bronze, Silver, and Gold; each has a different reward, maybe in points, maybe in discount, and maybe in free gifts.
