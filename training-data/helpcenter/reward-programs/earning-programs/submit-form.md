Q: How do customers earn rewards with Submit Form?
A: This feature is available for **Advanced and above plans**

### Overview

Submit Form is an earning program for actions that can't be tracked automatically — like sharing on social media, posting UGC content, or leaving feedback on external platforms. Customers complete the task, submit proof via a customizable form, and receive rewards after admin approval.

**Use case:** Merchants wanting to reward social shares, TikTok posts with hashtags, Google reviews, UGC content, or any custom action.

### How to set up

#### Step 1: Create the program

1. Go to **Reward programs → Earning programs → Add new**
2. Select **Submit form**
3. You can create multiple Submit Form programs for different actions

#### Step 2: Configure Rule tab

- **Program name** and **Description**
- **Start/End date** (optional)
- **Reward value:** Points earned after approval
- **Instant reward:** (optional) Give small points immediately on submit, before review
- **Differ by VIP tier:** (optional) Set different rewards per tier
- **Fraud prevention:** Limit submissions per timeframe (e.g., 3 per day)

#### Step 3: Configure Design tab

Customize the popup UI customers see when submitting.

**Form View:**

- Upload image
- Headline text (e.g., "Share on TikTok")
- Detailed description with instructions
- Input label and placeholder
- Submit button text

**Success View:**

- Success icon
- Headline (e.g., "Submission Received")
- Message body (e.g., "Points will be awarded after review")

#### Step 4: Save and activate

Click **Save**. Make sure program status is **Active**.

### Customer experience

#### Submitting a form

Customers can submit from:

- **Widget** → Way to earn → Submit form program
- **Loyalty page** → Block "Way to earn" → Submit form program

They enter text/link + optional images (max 5, JPG/PNG/JPEG, 10MB each).

#### After submission

- Customer sees success message
- If **Instant reward** enabled → points added immediately
- Submission status is **Pending** until staff reviews
- Once approved → full reward granted, logged in activity history
- If rejected → no reward. If instant reward was given, it will be refunded

### Admin review process

Go to **Activities → Submitted forms** to see all submissions.

Table columns:

- Submitted time
- Program name
- Customer name & email
- Submitted content (with copy button)
- Images (click to view/zoom)
- Status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)

#### Approve or Reject
