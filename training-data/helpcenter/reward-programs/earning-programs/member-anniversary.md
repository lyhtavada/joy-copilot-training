Q: What is Member Anniversary in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Member Anniversary work?
Q: How do customers earn rewards with Member Anniversary?
A: This feature is available for **Advanced and Enterprise** plans

### What is this feature?

Anniversary rewards let you automatically give customers points or discounts when they reach specific membership milestones in your loyalty program. This might be 30 days, 6 months, or 1 year after they joined. Unlike birthday rewards that celebrate your customers' personal milestones, anniversary rewards recognize their loyalty journey with your brand.

### Why you should use anniversary rewards

Most loyalty programs focus on transactional rewards like points for purchases or product reviews. Anniversary rewards create emotional touchpoints that remind customers they're valued members of your community. When someone receives a reward simply for being part of your program for six months, it reinforces their decision to stay engaged with your brand. This kind of recognition encourages customers to remain active in your program and strengthens their connection to your store.

### Set up an anniversary reward

Before you create an anniversary reward, decide which milestone makes sense for your business. Some merchants reward customers at multiple intervals (30 days, 6 months, 1 year), while others focus on just one significant anniversary like the one-year mark.

**To create an anniversary reward:**

1. From your Joy admin, go to **Reward programs** > **Earning programs**.
2. Click **Add rule**.
3. Select **Member anniversary**.
4. Enter basic information:

   1. Program name and description
   2. Start and End date
5. Choose your reward type: **Points**, **Discount percentage**, or **Discount amount**. and the reward **value**
6. Under **Member anniversary**, enter the number of days after signup when customers should receive the reward (for example, 365 for a one-year anniversary).
7. Click **Save**.

The reward will activate automatically on each customer's anniversary date. Customers can view and claim their anniversary rewards from their loyalty page.

### Choose the right anniversary timing

The anniversary timing you select depends on your business model and customer behavior. Consider these approaches:

**Early milestone (30-90 days):** Works well if you want to reward customers who stay engaged past the typical drop-off period. This early recognition can reinforce the habit of returning to your store.

**Mid-term milestone (6 months):** Ideal for businesses with seasonal purchase cycles or subscription models. Six months is long enough to represent meaningful loyalty without being too far away.

**Annual milestone (365 days):** Best for celebrating customers who demonstrate long-term commitment. Annual rewards often carry more weight and can include higher-value benefits or exclusive perks for VIP tier members.
