Q: What is Free Gift Program in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How do I set up Free Gift Program?
Q: How do customers earn rewards with Free Gift Program?
A: This feature is available for **Pro, Advanced and Enterprise** plans

### What is "Free gift program" feature?

The free gift program allows customers to redeem their loyalty points for specific products in your store. When customers redeem their points, they receive a unique coupon code that makes their chosen product free at checkout. For example, customers might use 200 points to get a free product of their choice from your selected offerings.

With the product selection enhancement, customers can now actively choose which product they want before applying the coupon, giving them more control over their rewards.

### Why do you need this feature?

The ability for customers to select products before redeeming points for free gifts offers several benefits. Increased customer satisfaction: Customers feel more in control when they can specifically choose which item they want from your selection of free gifts. Reduced confusion: Without this feature, the system would automatically select the first product, which might not be what the customer wanted. Higher redemption rates: When customers can choose exactly what they want, they're more likely to complete the redemption process.
