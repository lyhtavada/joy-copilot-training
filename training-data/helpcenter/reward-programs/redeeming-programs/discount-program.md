A: This feature is available for all plans

### What is "Discount program" feature?

The discount program allows customers to use their accumulated points to receive a discount on their purchases. Each discount becomes a unique, one-time-use coupon code that's automatically generated for your customers when they redeem their points.

### Why do you need this feature?

A points-to-discount program is a powerful tool for growing your business. When customers can easily turn their points into discounts, they're more likely to return to your store and make repeat purchases. Not only does this increase your average order value, but it also helps you stand out from competitors. We've seen merchants significantly boost their sales with this simple yet effective way to reward customer loyalty. Think of it as an investment in your customers that pays off in long-term business growth!
