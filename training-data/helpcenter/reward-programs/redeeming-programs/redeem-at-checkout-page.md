### What is Redeem at checkout page?

Redeem at checkout page is a Shopify Plus feature that lets customers apply rewards, discounts, or loyalty points directly at checkout. This seamless experience enhances convenience, boosts satisfaction, and encourages repeat purchases—all without leaving the checkout page.

### Why does Redeem at checkout page matter?

Redeem at checkout page enhances the shopping experience by making it easy for customers to apply rewards without leaving checkout. This reduces friction, increases conversion rates, and strengthens customer loyalty. A smooth redemption process also encourages repeat purchases, helping Shopify Plus merchants maximize engagement and sales.

### FAQs

#### Can we dynamically translate content in this checkout UI block by IP or browser language?

Unfortunately, we cannot. This is due to Shopify's limit with the [Checkout UI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/checkout-ui-extensions) extensions. We can have input in the Theme Editor to change the default translation language to one main language at the checkout only, unlike the loyalty page and widget. Hopefully, in the future, Shopify will support i18n for this.
