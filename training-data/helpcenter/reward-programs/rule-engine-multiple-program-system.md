Q: What is Rule Engine Multiple Program System in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Rule Engine Multiple Program System work?
Q: How do customers earn rewards with Rule Engine Multiple Program System?
A: This feature is available for: **Advanced and Enterprise plan**

### **Overview**

The Rule Engine introduces a multi-program system that allows you to create several earning programs, each with its own conditions, filters, and reward logic. Instead of adding extra checkboxes or tabs inside the default **Place order** program, you simply create new programs — each one functioning as an independent earning rule. Whenever a customer places an order, Joy evaluates all active programs and applies every program whose conditions are met.

This structure gives your loyalty program far greater flexibility. You can build dynamic earning rules that respond to real business scenarios: seasonal promotions, high-value order incentives, product-specific multipliers, weekend or after-hours bonuses, birthday-month boosters, or targeted campaigns for selected customer segments.

With multiple programs running side by side, your loyalty strategy becomes more adaptive, more precise, and significantly more effective.

### **How Multi-Program Logic Works**

Every earning rule you create acts as its own program. When a customer performs an action such as placing an order, Joy evaluates all active programs and applies every program whose conditions are met.

This means:

- Customers can earn points from **multiple programs at the same time**
- Programs can be targeted to **specific customers, collections, or time frames**
- Rules do not replace each other — they **stack** unless conditions prevent overlap
- Merchants can run **always-on programs** alongside **temporary or seasonal campaigns**

This gives you complete freedom to design layered earning logic.

### **What You Can Build With the Rule Engine**

Below are common use cases that show how flexible and powerful the Rule Engine can be when designing your loyalty experience.

#### **1. Standard Purchase Program (Always-On Base Rule)**

A foundational program that awards a default earning rate for every completed purchase, such as:

- Earn 1 point per $1 spent on every order

This forms your primary earning structure and runs continuously unless disabled.

#### **2. Collection-Specific Bonus Programs**

Create extra multipliers for products or collections that you want to highlight or drive traffic toward. For example:

- Earn 2× points on the “Summer Collection”
- Earn 50 bonus points on eco-friendly tagged products
- Earn 3× points on clearance items to accelerate sell-through
- Return can at POS for recycle, bonus X point. You can place an order, create a custom sale item, add the product title condition.

These programs only activate when the order includes eligible items.

Combine with a [product label app](https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=product%20label) to make the offer noticable on the collections page.
