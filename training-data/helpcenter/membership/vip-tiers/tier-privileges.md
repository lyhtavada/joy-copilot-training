Q: How do I set up Tier Privileges?
Q: How does Tier Privileges work with VIP tiers?
A: This feature is available for: **Advanced, Enterprise plans**.

### What are Tier Privileges

Tier Privileges (also known as Perks) allow you to offer exclusive rewards to customers based on their loyalty tier status. These rewards can include discount amounts, discount percentages, free shipping, free products, bonus points, and custom rewards.

With the improved Tier Privileges feature, you can now add multiple instances of the same discount type within a single tier. For example, you can create several different discount amount rewards for your Gold tier members, each applying to different products or collections.

### Why do you need Tier Privileges (Perks)?

Tier Privileges also have a significant impact on purchase behavior. By offering special discounts and perks, you encourage customers to add more items to their cart to maximize their exclusive benefits, effectively boosting your average order value. Meanwhile, your VIP customers enjoy an enhanced shopping experience where they feel genuinely valued through access to benefits that aren't available to everyone else.

From a competitive standpoint, a well-designed tier privileges system helps your loyalty program stand out in the marketplace. When customers can clearly see the increasing benefits as they progress through your tiers, they're motivated to reach higher levels—creating a natural progression path that drives engagement. And with the ability to now add multiple discount types targeting specific products or collections, you can create a highly customized shopping experience that aligns perfectly with your business strategy and customer preferences.

### Understanding the Rules

Tier Privileges are set by the merchant and can include one or more rewards. Once a member reaches a specific tier, all their orders automatically receive the associated benefits. Here's a quick breakdown:

- **Select Rewards**: Merchants choose rewards like discounts, free shipping, products, or bonus points.
- **Automatic Application**: Once a member reaches a tier, selected rewards are automatically applied to all future orders.
