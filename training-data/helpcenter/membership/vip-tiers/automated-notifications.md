Q: What is Automated Notifications in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Automated Notifications work?
Q: How does Automated Notifications work with VIP tiers?
A: This feature is available for **All** plans

### Understanding the Rules

The **Notifications** feature allows you to **automatically** send emails to customers whenever their **reward points change**—whether they **earn** or **redeem** points. This eliminates the need for **manual notifications**.

Available Notifications:

- Reward Programs: Birthday rewards, Earn points, POS point redemption, Redeem points
- Referral Programs: Coupons for referrers, Points for referrers, Referrals for friends
- VIP Tier: Notification when a customer reaches VIP status
- Points Expiry (Coming soon): Pre-notifications and last-call reminders for expiring points
- Send these emails through the default Joy app email sender, a custom sender address, or configure your own custom SMTP for full control over email delivery

### Toggling notifications

By default, notifications are disabled. There are two levels of notification settings:

**Global Enable/Disable:**

- You can **enable or disable** all notifications at once.
- If the **global setting** is disabled, **no notification emails** will be sent, even if individual program notifications are turned on.
- **To enable:**

  1. Go to the **Notifications** section in the **Joy app**.
  2. Switch on the **global toggle**.

**Individual Program Notifications:**

- Once notifications are **globally enabled**, you can customize them for **specific programs**.
- **To enable/disable individual program notifications:**

  1. Navigate to the **specific program** (e.g., Earn Points, Birthday Rewards).
  2. Toggle notifications **on or off** based on your preference.
