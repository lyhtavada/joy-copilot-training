Q: What is Tier Assessment in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How do I set up Tier Assessment?
Q: How does Tier Assessment work with VIP tiers?
A: This feature is available for the **Enterprise** plan.

### **Introduction**

For Shopify Plus merchants using the enterprise plan, keeping your loyalty program members in the right tiers is essential for maintaining engagement and rewarding your top spenders.

The Tier Assessment feature allows you to automatically review your customers' spending habits to determine if they should maintain their current VIP status or be moved to a lower tier.

### Understanding the Rules

The Tier Assessment feature operates by allowing merchants to set the following parameters:

- **Assessment Cycle (X):** The period after which the customer’s spending will be reviewed.
- **Order Review Timeframe (Y):** The specific timeframe in which orders are evaluated.
- **Spending Threshold (Z):** The minimum amount a customer must spend within the set timeframe to retain their tier.

After each cycle (X), the system assesses whether customers have met the spending criteria (Z) within the specified timeframe (Y). If not, they may be downgraded to a lower tier.
