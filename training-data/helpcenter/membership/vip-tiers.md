#### Set up Tiers

Tier configuration settings

**Tier calculating rule:** Define the method for calculating customer tiers. You can choose between **Points earned**, **Amount spent**, and **Number of orders**. Choosing between them depends on how you want to structure your program.

- **Points earned**: Tiers depend on total points collected, including from purchases, referrals, and reviews. This encourages broader engagement beyond spending.
- **Amount spent**: Tiers are based on total spending. Ideal if you want to reward high spenders. Customers still earn and use points for rewards.
- **Number of orders**: Tiers are based on how many orders a customer has placed. Great for stores that value frequent purchases — customers unlock higher tiers as they complete more orders, encouraging consistent shopping behavior.

**Discount code's prefix**: Personalize the prefix for discount codes generated within your VIP Tiers program. Make it match your brand.

**Note**: the code's prefix must be in the format ABCD-
