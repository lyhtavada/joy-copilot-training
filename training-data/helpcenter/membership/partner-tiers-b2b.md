Q: How does Partner Tiers B2B work with VIP tiers?
A: This feature is available for **Advanced** and **Enterprise** plans with **Shopify Plus** for [B2B Compatibility](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b)

### What is the B2B VIP Tier feature

The B2B VIP Tier feature provides specialized loyalty tiers designed exclusively for business customers. Unlike regular tiers that focus on individual consumers, B2B tiers offer benefits that matter to business buyers, such as payment terms, catalog access restrictions, volume-based discounts, and company-wide tier management.

This feature integrates seamlessly with Shopify's B2B functionality to provide personalized experiences based on how much a business has spent over their lifetime relationship with your store. Companies automatically inherit tier benefits that apply to all business account members.

### Why you should use B2B VIP Tiers

B2B VIP Tiers create powerful incentives for businesses to increase their spending while providing appropriate rewards for your highest-value customers. Unlike individual loyalty programs, B2B tiers recognize that business purchases are typically higher value, recurring, and involve multiple decision-makers within the organization.

These specialized tiers help you retain valuable business customers by offering benefits that align with B2B purchasing patterns. Extended payment terms, access to exclusive product catalogs, and volume discounts all address the specific needs of business buyers. When companies see clear progression paths and increasingly valuable benefits, they're motivated to consolidate their purchasing with your business.
