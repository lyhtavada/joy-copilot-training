Q: What is Membership Subscription in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Membership Subscription work?
Q: How does Membership Subscription work with VIP tiers?
A: ## Introduction to Subscription Membership

Turn your loyal customers into recurring revenue streams. **Subscription Membership** allows you to create paid VIP programs (similar to Amazon Prime) where customers pay a recurring fee to unlock exclusive benefits, or automatically gain VIP status when they subscribe to your products.

#### Why use Subscription Membership?

Merging **Loyalty** with **Subscriptions** is one of the most powerful strategies to increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

- **💰 Predictable Recurring Revenue:** Instead of waiting for the next purchase, you generate guaranteed monthly or yearly income from membership fees.
- **🔒 Higher Retention:** Customers who pay for a membership are 80% more likely to shop with you again to utilize their paid perks (sunk cost fallacy).
- **💎 Exclusive Experience:** Segment your top-tier customers and treat them like true VIPs with special pricing, free shipping, or higher point multipliers.

#### Common Use Cases

Here are the two most popular ways merchants use this feature:

**1. The "Paid VIP Club" (Amazon Prime Style)**

- **How it works:** You sell a virtual product called "VIP Pass" ($10/month).
- **The Value:** Customers buy it solely to get benefits like Free Shipping on all orders, 2x Points earning, or access to member-only products.

**2. The "Subscribe & Save" VIP**

- **How it works:** Customers subscribe to a physical product (e.g., Monthly Coffee Delivery).
- **The Value:** As a reward for their subscription commitment, they are automatically upgraded to your "Gold Tier" and stay there as long as their subscription is active.

#### How to set it up

Joy Loyalty offers two ways to power your Subscription Membership, depending on your tech stack.

This is the seamless, "plug-and-play" solution. By using **Joy Subscription** alongside Joy Loyalty, you get a native integration that requires zero coding and no external automation tools.

- **Pros:** Easiest setup, automatic tier syncing, unified support, and **Free Advanced Plan upgrade** for Joy Subscription users.
- **Best for:** Merchants who want a hassle-free, all-in-one solution.

**Option 2: Flexible Integration via Shopify Flow (Legacy) ⚙️**

If you are already using a third-party subscription app (like Recharge, Skio, Bold, or Loop), you can still create a membership program using Shopify Flow to connect the dots.

- **Pros:** Works with your existing subscription stack.
- **Cons:** Requires setting up workflows in Shopify Flow to handle tagging and tier assignment manually.
- **Best for:** Merchants who are deeply tied to another subscription provider.
