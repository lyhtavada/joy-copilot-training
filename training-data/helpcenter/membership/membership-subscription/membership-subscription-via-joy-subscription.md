Q: How does Membership Subscription Via Joy Subscription work with VIP tiers?
A: This feature is available for merchants on **Joy Advanced** plans and above who have exclusive tiers configured in their loyalty program.

Previously, creating a paid membership program required complex setups using Shopify Flow. Now, with the deep integration between **Joy: Loyalty Program** and **Joy: Subscription App**, you can build a seamless "Subscribe for exclusive Benefits" program directly within the app.

This guide walks you through the complete setup: from creating the Exclusive tier to displaying the subscription widget on your store.

### How to set up

#### Step 1: Create an Exclusive Tier

1. In Joy admin, go to **Membership** > **New tier**
2. Check the **"Exclusive tier (Manual only)"** checkbox
3. Set up tier perks like percentage discounts, free shipping, bonus points multipliers, and entry rewards
4. Click **Save**

*Note: Exclusive tiers are not achievable by earning points; customers can only enter via specific actions like purchasing a subscription, manually assigned, shopify flow...*

#### Step 2: Access Subscription Membership & Connect Apps

1. Navigate to **Membership** > **Subscription membership**.
2. You will see an integration banner. Click **Connect now**

*Note: If you've not installed Joy subscription, please install it first before click "Connect now"*

> **🎁 Great News:** If you are on the **Joy Loyalty Advanced plan**, connecting the apps will automatically upgrade your Joy Subscription account to the **Advanced plan for FREE** (no double charge).

#### Step 3: Create a Membership Plan

Now, define which product triggers the exclusive tier status.

1. Click **Add subscription plan**.
2. **Select Product:** Search for and select the product you want to sell as a membership (e.g., "The Collection Snowboard").

1. **Configure Plan Settings:**

   - **Assign to exclusive tier:** Select the Tier created in Step 1.
   - **Billing Frequency:** Set how often the customer pays (e.g., "Every 1 Month").
   - **Payment Type:** Choose between "Pay as you go" or "Prepaid".
   - ...

1. Click **Save**. *(Result: The plan is created in Joy Loyalty and automatically synced to Joy Subscription).*

#### Step 4: Enable Joy Subscription & Add Widget (Crucial Step)

For customers to buy this plan, you must display the subscription option on your storefront.

1. Go to **Joy Subscription app, you will see a warning banner, click "Activate"**

1. Hit **"Save"** to activate the app

1. **Add Widget:**

- In Joy subscription, click menu **"Widget"**
- Click **"Add widget"** and hit **"Save"**
