Q: What is Membership Subscription Via Other Apps in Joy Loyalty?
Q: How does Membership Subscription Via Other Apps work?
Q: How does Membership Subscription Via Other Apps work with VIP tiers?
A: This feature is available for merchants on **Joy Advanced** plans and above who have exclusive tiers configured in their loyalty program.

### Introduction

Subscription membership automatically assigns customers to exclusive tiers when they purchase membership subscriptions. Instead of earning VIP tier status through spending, customers can pay for instant access to exclusive benefits throughout their subscription period.

### Our approach

To us, the membership is treated as a kind of VIP tier program, which also comes with perks, entry rewards, membership card display like what we have already built with VIP tiers. So, with flexibility at heart, we want to craft a solution that fits seamlessly with the existing Shopify ecosystem. That is why our tech stack utilizes the Shopify Flow, along with any Shopify-friendly subscription apps (which use the [Shopify selling plans API](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/sellingplan)).

See our existing guide on the [Exclusive tier feature](https://help.joy.so/membership/exclusive-tier)

### Why you should use subscription membership

Subscription membership creates a **consistent touchpoint that keeps customers actively engaged** with your brand month after month. Rather than waiting for customers to make their next purchase, you're providing ongoing value that gives them regular reasons to return, interact, and stay connected with your business.

The predictable monthly recurring revenue is a valuable byproduct, but the real power lies in transforming occasional buyers into consistently engaged community members. Unlike spending-based tiers where customers might lose benefits during natural purchase lulls, subscription members maintain their connection to your brand regardless of their buying cycles. This sustained engagement means they're more likely to think of you first when they are ready to purchase, recommend you to others, and develop genuine loyalty that goes beyond individual transactions.

This approach turns customer retention from a reactive challenge into a proactive relationship-building strategy, where the subscription itself becomes a bridge that keeps customers connected between purchases.

### Setting up subscription membership

Here is the video guide for hands-on guidance if you want a more interactive experience:

#### Step 1: Create exclusive tiers

1. In Joy admin, go to **Membership** > **New tier**
2. Check the **"Exclusive tier (Manual only)"** checkbox
3. Set up tier perks like percentage discounts, free shipping, bonus points multipliers, and entry rewards

You can have many exclusive tiers just for a subscription-membership-only program. We are giving a demo for the hydbrid option.
