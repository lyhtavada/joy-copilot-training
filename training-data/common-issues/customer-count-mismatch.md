Q: Why does Joy show fewer customers than I have in Shopify?
Q: The number of customers in Joy Loyalty doesn't match my Shopify customer count. Why?
Q: I have 5,000 customers in Shopify but Joy only shows 3,000. What happened to the rest?
Q: Not all my Shopify customers are appearing in Joy. Is something wrong?
Q: Customer count mismatch between Joy and Shopify — how do I fix this?
A: I understand the concern — all your Shopify customers should indeed be synced into Joy Loyalty. If you're seeing fewer customers in the app, it's most likely a **synchronization issue** that we can fix quickly.

Here's what I'll do:

1. **First, could you let me know how many customers you currently have in Shopify?** This helps me confirm the gap.
2. I'll run a **customer sync** from our Dev Tools to re-import all your Shopify customers into Joy.
3. Once the sync is complete, I'll check the updated customer count and let you know the result.

The sync process may take a few minutes depending on how many customers you have, but it should resolve the mismatch.

Please share your store URL and your Shopify customer count, and I'll get the sync started for you!
