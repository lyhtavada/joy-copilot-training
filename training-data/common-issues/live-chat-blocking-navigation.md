Q: The live chat bubble is covering the navigation buttons on the Customers page. How do I fix this?
Q: I can't see or click the buttons on the Customers page because the live chat is in the way. What should I do?
Q: On my small laptop screen, the chat widget is blocking important buttons in Joy. Is there a workaround?
Q: The navigation buttons on the Joy Customers page are hidden behind the live chat widget. Help!

A: We understand this can be frustrating, especially on smaller laptop screens (under 14 inches). Here are two quick solutions:

### Option 1: Zoom Out Your Browser
Simply zoom out your browser screen to see the hidden buttons:
- **Windows/Linux:** Press `Ctrl` + `-` (minus key)
- **Mac:** Press `Cmd` + `-` (minus key)
- You can also go to your browser menu and adjust the zoom level (try 80% or 90%)

This will make everything slightly smaller but will reveal the buttons that were being covered by the live chat widget.

### Option 2: Use the Additional Navigation Button
Our team has already added an **extra navigation button above the original position** on the Customers page specifically to address this issue. Look for it higher up on the page -- it provides the same functionality and should be fully visible even on smaller screens.

You can zoom back to 100% (`Ctrl/Cmd` + `0`) once you're done if you prefer the default view.
