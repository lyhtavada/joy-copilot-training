Q: The Joy Loyalty extension is not loading on my POS device. It just shows an error. What should I do?
Q: I'm trying to use Joy Loyalty on my Shopify POS but the extension won't show up. How can I fix this?
Q: My POS staff says the Joy app tile is broken or not appearing on the POS screen. Can you help?
Q: The Joy Loyalty POS extension keeps crashing or failing to load. What's wrong?
Q: I installed Joy Loyalty but it doesn't work on my POS terminal. The extension either doesn't appear or shows an error message.

A: There are several reasons the Joy Loyalty POS extension might not load properly. Let's troubleshoot step by step:

**1. Verify your plan supports POS integration**
The POS extension is available on the **$39.99/month plan and above**. If you're on a lower plan, you'll need to upgrade to access POS features.

**2. Check you have the latest extension version**
Make sure you're running the most recent version of the Joy POS extension. The tile name on your POS should display as **"Joy Loyalty"**. If it shows an older name or version, you may need to update it.

**3. Update your POS device and app**
- Ensure your POS device's operating system (iOS or Android) is up to date.
- Update the Shopify POS app to the latest version from the App Store or Google Play Store.
- After updating, remove the Joy Loyalty tile from your POS and re-add it.

**4. Try re-adding the extension**
- On your POS device, go to the app settings or tile management area.
- Remove the Joy Loyalty extension tile.
- Add it back and check if it loads correctly.

**5. Still not working?**
If none of the above steps resolve the issue, please provide us with:
- Your POS device model and OS version
- The Shopify POS app version
- A screenshot or description of the error message

We may need to request POS staff access to your store so our development team can investigate the issue directly.

Escalate khi: Extension still fails to load after updating the POS device, app, and re-adding the tile. Dev team needs POS staff access for further investigation.
