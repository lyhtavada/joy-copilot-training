problem: Merchant added custom email sender and verified email, but app still shows Unverified

Q: I added my custom email sender and verified it, but the app still shows "Unverified." Why?
Q: My custom sender email says unverified even though I already clicked the verification link. What should I do?
Q: I verified my email address for the custom sender but the status won't update to verified. Help!
Q: The custom email sender I added is stuck on "Unverified" even after verification. How do I fix this?
A: We understand how frustrating that can be! There are a couple of reasons why your custom email sender might still show as "Unverified" even after you've gone through the verification process.

Let's troubleshoot this together:

1. **Double-check verification**: Please make sure you actually clicked the **verification link** in the email that was sent to your custom email address. Sometimes it's easy to miss or it may have landed in your **spam/junk folder**.

2. **Resend verification**: We can resend the verification email to you. Once you receive it, click the verify link right away and then check the app status.

3. **Validate your email**: We'll run a quick check on your email address using our validation tool to make sure it's a valid, deliverable address.

4. If the email is valid and you've clicked the verification link but it's still showing as unverified, we may need to try the verification process a few more times.

If after multiple attempts the status still doesn't update, don't worry -- we'll escalate this to our technical team to investigate and resolve it for you.

Please share the custom email address you're trying to verify, and we'll get started!

Escalate khi: The email is validated as valid, the merchant has clicked the verification link multiple times, and the status still shows Unverified -- escalate to the dev team with the merchant's store info and the email address in question.
