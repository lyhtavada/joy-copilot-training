Q: A customer left a product review but didn't get any points for it. Why?
Q: Review points are not being awarded even though customers are writing reviews. What's wrong?
Q: Customer submitted a review but no loyalty points were added. How do I fix this?
Q: Why aren't points given when customers write reviews on my store?
Q: Review reward program is not working — customers write reviews but get no points. What should I check?
A: There are several requirements for the review points program to work correctly. Let's go through them:

1. **Confirm the review app is connected.** Go to Joy app > Reward programs and check that a "Write reviews" program exists and is enabled. The review app (e.g., Judge.me, Loox, Ali Reviews, etc.) must be properly connected to Joy.

2. **Both apps must be on paid plans.** This is a critical requirement! Both the Joy app **and** the review app must be on **paid plans** for the integration to work. If either app is on a free plan, points will not be awarded for reviews.

3. **The review must be published.** Joy only awards points after a review is **published** (approved), not when it's submitted or still in a pending/moderation state. Ask the merchant to check if the review has been approved and published in their review app.

4. **If all of the above are correct** but points are still not being awarded, this needs further investigation. Please provide:
   - The name of the review app being used
   - The plan the review app is on
   - The plan Joy is on

5. **Workaround:** While waiting for a resolution, the merchant can **manually adjust the customer's points** in Joy to compensate for the missing review reward.

Escalate khi: Review app is connected, both apps are on paid plans, the review is published, but points were still not awarded. Escalate to dev with the review app name, plan information for both apps, and customer email.
