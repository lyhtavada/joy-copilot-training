Q: My customer didn't get their birthday reward even though today is their birthday. What's wrong?
Q: Why wasn't the birthday reward sent to the customer on their birthday?
Q: A customer is complaining they never received their birthday discount. How do I fix this?
Q: Birthday reward not showing up for a customer whose birthday is today. What should I check?
Q: Customer entered their birthday but didn't get any birthday reward. Why?
A: There are a few things to check when a customer doesn't receive their birthday reward:

1. **Make sure the Birthday program is enabled.** Go to Joy app > Reward programs and confirm that the "Celebrate a birthday" program is turned on.

2. **Check the 30-day rule.** This is the most common reason! Customers must enter their birthday **at least 30 days before** their actual birthday to receive the reward that year. If they entered it less than 30 days before their birthday, the reward will automatically shift to **next year**.

   - For example, if a customer's birthday is March 15 and they entered their birthday on March 1 (only 14 days before), they won't receive the reward this year. They'll get it next year instead.

3. **If the birthday was entered more than 30 days in advance and the program is enabled**, but the customer still didn't receive the reward, this may be a technical issue that needs further investigation.

Escalate khi: Customer entered their birthday at least 30 days before, the birthday program is enabled, but the reward was still not delivered. Escalate to dev team with customer email and birthday date.
