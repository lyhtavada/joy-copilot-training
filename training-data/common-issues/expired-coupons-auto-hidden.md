Q: Are expired coupons automatically removed from the Joy widget?
Q: My customer says they can see expired coupons on the loyalty widget. Is that normal?
Q: Do I need to manually hide expired coupons from the widget, or does Joy handle that?
Q: Will expired discount codes still show up on the loyalty widget for my customers?
A: No worries - **expired coupons are automatically hidden** from the Joy widget. You don't need to take any action!

Once a coupon passes its expiration date, Joy automatically removes it from the customer-facing widget so your customers won't see outdated or unusable discount codes.

If you're noticing an expired coupon still appearing, it may just need a moment to refresh. Try doing a hard refresh of the page (Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac). If it persists, please let us know and we'll look into it for you.
