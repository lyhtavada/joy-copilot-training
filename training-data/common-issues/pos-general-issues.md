Q: The POS tile for Joy isn't working correctly — it won't display loyalty information. What do I do?
A: POS issues can be caused by a system-wide bug or a store-specific problem. Here's how to troubleshoot step by step:

1. **Check that the merchant has the latest Joy POS Extension.** The POS tile should display as **"Joy Loyalty"**. If it shows a different name or looks outdated, the merchant may need to update or reinstall the extension.

2. **Test if the issue is system-wide or store-specific.** Our support team will check if the same issue occurs on our own test device:
   - **If we can reproduce the same issue** on our device, it's a system-wide bug. We'll report it to the dev team right away.
   - **If the issue does NOT occur on our device**, it's likely a store-specific problem. Continue with the steps below.

3. **For store-specific issues, ask the merchant to try these steps:**
   - Update the Shopify POS app to the latest version
   - Update the POS device software/firmware
   - Remove the Joy Loyalty tile from POS, then re-add it
   - Restart the POS device

4. **If the issue persists after the above steps**, we'll need more information to investigate further:
   - Device type and model (e.g., iPad, Android tablet, POS Go)
   - Device OS version
   - Shopify POS app version
   - If possible, grant POS access so we can test directly on their setup

Escalate khi: Issue is confirmed as system-wide (reproducible on our test device) — escalate immediately to dev. For store-specific issues, escalate to dev if the problem persists after reinstalling the extension and updating the device, and include device info and POS access credentials.
