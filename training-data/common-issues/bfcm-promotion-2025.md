Q: I heard about a Joy Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal. What's the promotion?
Q: Is there a BFCM discount available for Joy Loyalty right now?
Q: How do I use the Joy BFCM 2025 promotion code?
Q: I'm trying to apply a Joy BFCM discount but it says "invalid." What should I do?
Q: What are the Joy Black Friday 2025 offers and how do I qualify?
A: Great news - Joy is running a **BFCM 2025 Promotion** with some fantastic deals! The promotion runs **until December 15, 2025**. Here's what's available:

**Offer 1 - 30% OFF for 3 months:**
- **Who qualifies:** New stores or stores that have never upgraded to a paid plan before.
- **Discount code:** `JOY-BFCM2025`
- Apply this code when upgrading your plan to get 30% off for your first 3 months.

**Offer 2 - 30% OFF for 6 months:**
- **Who qualifies:** Stores that have previously been on a paid plan (including churned/cancelled stores).
- For this offer, our Sales team will set it up for you. We'll connect you with them to get this applied.

**If you didn't know about the promotion:**
Check out our BFCM promotion page for full details! We can share the link with you.

**If your discount code shows "invalid":**
This usually means your store may not be eligible for that particular tier. For example, if you've previously been on a paid plan, the 3-month code won't work - but you may qualify for the even better 6-month deal instead! We'll connect you with our Sales team to get you sorted.

Escalate khi: The merchant qualifies for the 6-month deal (previously paid/churned) and needs Sales to apply it, or the discount code is not working and eligibility cannot be determined.
