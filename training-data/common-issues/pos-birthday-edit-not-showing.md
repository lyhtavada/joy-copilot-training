Q: Birthday field is not editable on POS. What's going on?
A: I see this issue from time to time — here's what's happening and how to fix it!

**Why the edit option isn't showing:**
The POS extension only displays the birthday edit option when the **date format includes the year (YYYY)**. If a customer's birthday was saved in a format like **MM/DD** (without the year), the edit button won't appear on POS.

**How to fix it:**

1. **Check the customer's birthday format** in the Joy app on their customer detail page.
2. If the birthday is saved **without a year**, update it directly on the **customer detail page** in the Joy app (not through POS).
3. **Update your Birthday program's date format** to include the year — use either:
   - **MM/DD/YYYY**
   - **DD/MM/YYYY**

   This ensures all future birthday entries will include the year and the edit option will show up on POS.

4. After making these changes, check POS again — the edit button should now appear for that customer.

Would you like me to check the birthday format settings for your store? Just share your store URL and I'll take a look!

Escalate khi: Issue persists after changing the date format to include YYYY — request device info and POS access for further investigation.
