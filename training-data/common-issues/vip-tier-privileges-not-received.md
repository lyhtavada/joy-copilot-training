Q: A customer moved up to a new VIP tier but didn't get the privileges for that tier. Why?
Q: VIP tier privileges are not showing for a customer who just reached a new tier. What's wrong?
Q: Customer upgraded to Gold tier but can't see any of the tier benefits. How do I fix this?
Q: Why aren't VIP privileges being applied after a customer reaches a new membership level?
Q: Tier privileges not working for a customer who just leveled up. What should I check?
A: Here's how to troubleshoot when a customer doesn't receive their VIP tier privileges:

1. **Check if Privileges are set up correctly.** Go to Joy app > Rewards > Privileges and verify that privileges are configured for the relevant VIP tier. Make sure the correct rewards and benefits are assigned.

2. **Understand the difference between Privileges and Entry Rewards.** This is important!
   - **Privileges** are ongoing benefits that appear as "owned benefits" for the customer. They do **not** generate instant discount codes — instead, they show up as perks the customer can use as part of their tier membership.
   - **Entry Rewards** are one-time rewards given when a customer first reaches a tier (like a welcome discount code).

   If the merchant expects an automatic discount code, they may actually need to set up an **Entry Reward** instead of a Privilege.

3. **Confirm the store is on the Advanced plan.** Privileges are an **Advanced plan feature**. If the store is on a lower plan, this feature won't be available.

4. **Verify display conditions.** Check that the privilege display conditions are correctly configured so they appear for the right tier.

Escalate khi: Privileges are properly set up, the store is on the Advanced plan, and display conditions are correct, but the customer still doesn't see their privileges. Escalate to dev with customer email/ID, VIP tier name, and screenshots of the privilege settings.
