Q: Can you manually trigger a birthday reward for one of my customers?
Q: A customer didn't receive their birthday reward. Can you send it manually?
Q: The birthday reward didn't fire automatically for a customer. How do I resend it?
Q: I want to give a birthday reward to a specific customer right now. Is that possible?
Q: One of my customers missed their birthday reward due to a delay. Can you fix it?
A: Of course! I can manually trigger the birthday reward for a specific customer. Here's what I'll do:

**Steps to trigger the birthday reward:**

1. I'll go to **Dev Zone** > **Dev Tool**.
2. Find the option **"Trigger birthday for one customer"**.
3. Enter the **Customer ID** for the customer you'd like to reward.
4. Click **"Give birthday for one customer"** — I'll click this **only once** and wait for it to process (clicking multiple times could cause duplicate rewards).
5. The system will **send the birthday email** to the customer and the **discount will appear** on their customer detail page.

Once it's done, I'll confirm the reward was successfully triggered!

**What I need from you:**
- The **customer's email or name** so I can look up their Customer ID.
- Or if you already have their **Customer ID**, that works even better!

Just share those details and I'll get the birthday reward sent right away.
