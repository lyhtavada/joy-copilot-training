Q: My Shopify Flow with Joy isn't working. What should I check?
Q: I set up a flow in Shopify Flow using Joy triggers/actions but nothing happens. Why?
Q: Why isn't my Shopify Flow automation triggering for Joy loyalty actions?
Q: I created a Shopify Flow for Joy but it doesn't seem to be running. How do I fix it?
Q: The Shopify Flow I built to give points or rewards through Joy isn't firing. What's wrong?

A: There are a few reasons why your Shopify Flow with Joy might not be working. Let's troubleshoot step by step:

1. **Check if the integration is enabled**: In your Joy admin, go to **Integration** > **Shopify Flow** and make sure the Shopify Flow integration is **turned on**. This is a common miss!

2. **Review your Flow configuration**: Open the flow in the Shopify Flow app and double-check:
   - Are the triggers set up correctly?
   - Are the conditions/filters matching the right criteria?
   - Are the Joy actions configured with the correct parameters (e.g., correct point amounts, right reward type)?

3. **Share screenshots with us**: If everything looks correct on your end, please send us screenshots of your full Flow configuration (trigger, conditions, and actions) so we can review it.

4. **Test the flow**: Try triggering the flow manually or with a test order/customer to see if it activates.

If the setup looks correct but the flow still isn't working, we'll escalate this to our development team to investigate further.

Escalate khi: Flow setup is confirmed correct (integration enabled, configuration is proper) but the flow still does not trigger -- escalate to dev team as a potential integration bug.
