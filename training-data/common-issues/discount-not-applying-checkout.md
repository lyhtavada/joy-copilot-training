Q: A customer is trying to use their loyalty discount but it says it can't be combined. What do I do?
A: When a discount code generated by Joy isn't working at checkout, it's usually related to discount combination settings or conflicting discounts. Here's how to troubleshoot:

1. **Check for other active discounts.** Ask the merchant:
   - Are there any **automatic discounts** currently running? (These apply automatically at checkout without a code)
   - Are there any **other manual discount codes** that might conflict?
   - Shopify may block multiple discounts from being used together if combination settings aren't configured.

2. **Check Discount Combination settings.** In Shopify Admin > Discounts, each discount has a **"Combinations"** section that controls whether it can be used alongside other discounts. If the Joy discount or another active discount does not allow combinations, they will block each other.

   **To fix this:**
   - Go to **Shopify Admin** > **Discounts**
   - Open the relevant discount(s)
   - Scroll to the **"Combinations"** section
   - Enable the appropriate combination options (e.g., "This discount can be combined with product discounts, order discounts, or shipping discounts")
   - Save the changes

3. **Check discount conditions.** The discount may have conditions that aren't being met, such as:
   - Minimum order amount
   - Specific products or collections only
   - Customer eligibility requirements
   - Expiration date

4. **Request Discounts access** if you need to investigate further. Having access to the merchant's Shopify Discounts section will allow us to review all active discounts and their combination settings directly.

Escalate khi: Discount combination settings are correct, no conflicting discounts are active, conditions are met, but the discount still won't apply at checkout. Escalate to dev with the discount code, order details, and screenshots of the discount settings.
