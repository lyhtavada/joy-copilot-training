Q: How can I turn off the widget for a particular URL on my store?

A: You can easily hide the Joy widget on specific pages! Here's how:

1. First, confirm the **exact page URL** where you want to hide the widget (e.g., `https://yourstore.com/pages/wholesale`).
2. Go to **DevZone** in your Joy admin.
3. Find the **"Exclude page"** field.
4. Enter the page URL (or path) where you want the widget hidden.
5. Click **Save**.

That's it! The Joy loyalty widget will no longer appear on that specific page. You can add multiple pages if needed.
