Q: Can I get a discount on upgrading to a paid plan?
Q: Is there any promotion or discount available for your paid plans?
Q: I'd like to upgrade but the price is a bit high. Can you offer a better deal?
Q: Do you have any special pricing for loyal customers looking to upgrade?
Q: I'm interested in upgrading but would appreciate a discount. Is that possible?
A: Thank you for your interest in upgrading! We really appreciate you considering our paid plans.

We'd love to help you find the best option. To get started:

1. **Which plan are you interested in?** Let us know so we can provide the right details.
2. We'll check with our team to see what options might be available for you.

Please give us a little time to review your request, and we'll get back to you as soon as possible with an update!

Escalate khi: All discount requests must be forwarded to the Sales team or CS Lead for approval. CS agents cannot offer discounts independently. Forward to the #sales-cs-success channel with: store name, current plan, desired plan, reason for discount request, and the specific discount requested.
