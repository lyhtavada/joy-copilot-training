Q: I'm seeing a 422 error when generating my loyalty page hero banner. How do I fix it?
Q: Error 422 keeps appearing when I click generate on the loyalty hero banner. Help!
A: This 422 error happens because a loyalty page was already created in your Online Store the first time you clicked "Edit in theme editor." Since the page already exists, the system can't create a duplicate, which triggers the 422 error.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Go to your Shopify admin and navigate to **Online Store > Pages**.
2. Look for the loyalty page that was already created there.
3. If you find it, you can open and edit it directly from that page list -- no need to generate it again.
4. From there, you can customize the page however you like (colors, block sizes, visibility settings, etc.).

If you need help customizing the loyalty page layout or settings, just let us know and we'll be happy to walk you through it!

Escalate khi: The loyalty page does not exist in Online Store > Pages and the 422 error persists after retrying.
