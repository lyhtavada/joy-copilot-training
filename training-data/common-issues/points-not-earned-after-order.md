Q: A customer placed an order but didn't receive any loyalty points. Why?
Q: Points were not added after a customer completed a purchase. What should I check?
Q: Customer is asking why they didn't get points after buying something. How do I troubleshoot this?
Q: Order was placed but no points were earned. What's going on?
Q: Why aren't points being awarded when customers place orders?
A: There are a few settings that determine when and to whom points are awarded after an order. Let's go through them:

1. **Check the order status requirement.** Go to Joy app > Reward programs > Place order > Reward setting. Points are only awarded when the order reaches a specific status — either **Paid** or **Fulfilled**, depending on your settings. If the order hasn't reached that status yet, points won't be added.

2. **Check which customer types are eligible.** In the same settings area, look at the "Apply for" option. The program may be set to award points only to specific groups:
   - **All members** — only customers who have joined your loyalty program
   - **VIP** — only customers in a specific VIP tier
   - **Members and non-members** — all customers regardless of membership

   Make sure your customer's type matches the selected setting.

3. **Verify the order details.** Please provide the following so we can investigate:
   - Order number
   - Customer email
   - Current order status (Paid, Fulfilled, etc.)

4. **Compare the order against your settings.** If the order status and customer type both match your configuration but points still weren't awarded, this needs to be escalated for further investigation.

Escalate khi: Order status and customer type both match the app settings, but points were still not awarded. Escalate to TS with order number, customer email, and screenshots of the reward settings.
