Q: I can't search for customers by name, only by email. How do I fix this?
Q: Why doesn't the customer name search work? I can only find customers using their email address.
Q: The search in the Customers section doesn't return results when I type a customer's name. What should I do?
Q: Customer search by name is not working in the app. Is there a way to enable it?
A: This can happen when the search data needs to be refreshed. Here's how to fix it step by step:

1. Go to the **Dev Zone** in the app settings.
2. Use **CTRL+F** (or **Cmd+F** on Mac) to find the word **"search"** on the page.
3. Click the **"Reset search data"** button.
4. Then click the **"Sync search data"** button.
5. Check the **status toggle** on the right side -- make sure it is **enabled** (turned on). If it's not enabled, toggle it on.

After completing these steps, give it a moment and then try searching by customer name again. It should now work properly!

If the issue persists after following these steps, please let us know so we can investigate further.
