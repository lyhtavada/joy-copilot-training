Q: How do I export my customer data from the app?
Q: I don't see an option to export customers. Where is it?
Q: Can I download a list of all my loyalty customers with their information?
Q: I need to export my customer list but there's no export button. What do I do?
A: The export customers feature is available, but it may need to be enabled for your store first. Here's how to get it set up:

1. Go to the **Dev Zone** in the app settings.
2. Find and **enable** the option called **"Show button export customer"**.
3. Click **Save** to apply the change.

Once enabled, go back to the **Customers** page in the app, and you'll now see the **"Export customers"** button available.

Click it to download your customer data along with their associated loyalty information. If you have any trouble finding the option or need further assistance, just let us know!
