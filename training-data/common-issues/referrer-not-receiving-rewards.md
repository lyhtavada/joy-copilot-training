problem: Referrer not receiving rewards after referee placed an order

Q: My customer referred a friend but didn't get their referral reward. Why?
Q: The referral program isn't working — the referrer didn't receive any points after the referee ordered.
Q: A referred friend placed an order but the person who referred them got nothing. Can you check?
Q: Why didn't the referrer get rewarded even though the referee completed a purchase?
Q: Referral reward not triggered after successful order. What's going on?
A: I'm sorry to hear the referral reward didn't come through! Let me help you figure out what happened.

The most common reason this occurs is that the **referee placed the order using a different email** than the one they provided when they received the referral discount. When the emails don't match, the system can't connect the order back to the referral.

Here's what I need to investigate this:

1. **The referrer's email address**
2. **The referee's email address**
3. **Access to your Orders** (so I can verify the referee's order was paid and fulfilled)

Once I have this info, I'll:
- Check if the referral flow was followed correctly end-to-end.
- Verify that the referee's order is fully paid and fulfilled (both conditions must be met for the reward to trigger).
- Confirm whether the emails match across the referral and the order.

If everything checks out and the reward still didn't trigger, it may be a system issue that I'll escalate to our development team for a fix.

Could you share those details so I can look into it right away?

Escalate khi: Referral flow was followed correctly, order is paid/fulfilled, emails match, but reward still not triggered — likely a bug, escalate to dev team.
