A: If your store is currently running Joy Loyalty widget version 2 (v2), we strongly recommend upgrading to **version 3 (v3)**. Here's why and how:

**Why upgrade to v3?**
- **Better design** -- Widget v3 has a modern, cleaner look that provides a much better experience for your customers.
- **Improved performance** -- v3 loads faster and runs more smoothly across all devices.
- **Full feature support** -- Some newer features and settings may not work properly on the outdated v2 widget. Upgrading ensures you have access to everything Joy offers.
- **Ongoing support** -- Widget v2 is no longer actively maintained, so future updates and improvements will only be available on v3.

**How to upgrade:**
1. **Back up your current settings** -- Before making any changes, take note of (or screenshot) your current widget customizations (colors, text, position, etc.) so you can re-apply them in v3 if needed.
2. **Contact our support team** -- Let us know you'd like to upgrade from v2 to v3. We'll follow our conversion guide to switch your widget over smoothly.
3. **Review the new widget** -- After the upgrade, visit your live store and check that the new widget displays correctly. Pay attention to the design, colors, text, and functionality.
4. **Adjust settings if needed** -- If anything looks off or you'd like to tweak the v3 widget's appearance, you can customize it in **Joy > Onsite content > Widget**.
5. **Let us know if you need help** -- After the conversion, if anything doesn't look right or you need assistance re-applying your custom styles, we're happy to help.

The upgrade process is straightforward and our team will handle the technical conversion for you. Just give us the green light and we'll get started!

Escalate khi: Conversion from v2 to v3 causes display issues or breaks existing functionality on the store. Dev team intervention may be needed.
