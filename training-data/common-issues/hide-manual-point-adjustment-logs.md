Q: How can I hide manual point adjustments from showing on the loyalty widget for my customers?
Q: I manually added points for a customer complaint but I don't want them to see that log entry. Can I hide it?
Q: My customers are confused by "manual adjustment" entries in their points history. How do I remove those?
Q: Is there a way to prevent manual point corrections from appearing on the customer-facing loyalty page?
Q: I need to hide admin point adjustments from the widget and account page. What are my options?
A: Great question! Manual point adjustments (like adding or deducting points for complaints, corrections, etc.) can sometimes confuse customers when they see them in their activity log. You have two options to handle this:

**Option 1 - Hide from customer view (Recommended):**
1. Go to **Dev Zone** in your Joy admin.
2. Find and enable the setting **"Enable hide adjust point activity for customer"**.
3. Once enabled, manual adjustment logs will be hidden from the widget and loyalty page, but they are still fully visible in your admin dashboard for your records.

This is the recommended approach because it keeps your admin audit trail intact while giving customers a cleaner experience.

**Option 2 - Delete the logs completely:**
If you need the logs removed entirely (not just hidden), we can have our dev team handle that for you.
1. Please provide your **store name** and the **time range** of the adjustments you want removed.
2. We'll create a task for our dev team to remove those entries from the frontend.
3. We'll follow up with you once the dev team confirms the removal is complete.

**Important note:** Hiding (Option 1) only affects the customer-facing display. Your admin audit trail is always preserved regardless of which option you choose.

Escalate khi: The "Enable hide adjust point activity for customer" toggle is not available in Dev Zone, or Option 2 is requested (needs dev team involvement).
