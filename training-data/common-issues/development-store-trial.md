Q: I have a development store and want to try the paid features. How can I upgrade?
Q: Can I extend my trial on a development store? I need more time to test.
Q: I'm on a dev store and can't upgrade to a paid plan. What are my options?
Q: Why can't I accept app charges on my development store?
Q: I want to test premium features on my development store before going live.
A: Thanks for your interest in exploring our paid features! Unfortunately, **development stores** have a Shopify limitation where they **cannot accept app charges** until the store is either:

- **Transferred to a customer**, or
- **You choose a Shopify subscription plan** for the store

This is a Shopify platform restriction, not something on our end.

But don't worry -- we have a few ways to help you out:

1. **Trial extension**: We can extend your free trial so you have more time to explore the app.
2. **Temporary paid feature access**: We can temporarily unlock paid features on your development store so you can test everything out.
3. **Live demo/walkthrough**: We'd love to schedule a quick call to walk you through all the features. Here's our booking link so you can pick a time that works for you.

Just let us know which plan you're interested in and we'll get you set up!

Escalate khi: Merchant declines a demo call -- forward to the Sales team via the #sales-cs-success channel with store details and the merchant's request.
