Q: Why is the Notifications feature disabled in my Joy Loyalty app?
Q: I can't turn on Notifications. It says the feature is disabled. How do I fix this?
Q: The email notification feature is greyed out and I can't use it. What's wrong?
Q: I just installed Joy but Notifications are not available. Why?
Q: How do I enable the Notifications feature? It seems to be locked.
A: I'm sorry for the inconvenience! The Notifications feature may be temporarily disabled on your store as part of our **anti-spam protection measures**. This is something we put in place to keep the platform safe and prevent misuse.

Here's what I'll do to help:

1. **Could you share your store URL?** I need to verify your store first.
2. I'll review your store to confirm everything looks good.
3. Once verified, I'll **enable the Notifications feature** for your store from our end.

This process is quick — once I've confirmed your store, I can have Notifications turned on for you right away!

Please share your store URL and I'll get started.

Escalate khi: Store appears to be illegitimate or potentially used for phishing/spam after review — deny the request and explain that the feature cannot be enabled.
