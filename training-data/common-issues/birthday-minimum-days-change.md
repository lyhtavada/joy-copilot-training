Q: How do I change the minimum number of days before a birthday that customers need to enter their date of birth?
Q: The default is 30 days for birthday entry. Can I change that to a different number?
Q: I want customers to be able to enter their birthday closer to the actual date. How do I adjust this setting?
Q: Can I modify the birthday lead time requirement from the default 30 days?
A: Absolutely! The default setting requires customers to enter their birthday at least 30 days in advance, but this can be adjusted to any number you prefer.

Here's how to change it:

1. Let us know the **new number of days** you'd like to set (for example, 7 days, 14 days, etc.).
2. We'll go to the **Dev Zone** and update the **"Birthday allowed after"** field with your preferred value.
3. We'll click **Save** to apply the change.
4. Once done, we'll confirm the update with you.

The change takes effect immediately, so your customers will see the new minimum day requirement right away.

Just tell us the number of days you'd like, and we'll get it updated for you!
