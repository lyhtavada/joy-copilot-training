Q: When does Joy start calculating usage fees?
Q: What date does the usage fee begin from?
Q: How is the billing cycle calculated for Joy's usage fee?
Q: I'm confused about when my usage fee period starts. Can you explain?
Q: Does the usage fee start from when I installed the app or when my trial ended?
A: Great question! Here's how Joy's usage fee and billing cycle work:

**The usage fee starts from your trial start date** (the day you installed and started using the app), not from when the trial ends.

Joy offers a **14-day free trial**, so the usage fee tracking period and the Shopify billing cycle will be offset by 14 days. Here's an example to make it clear:

**Example:**
- **Trial starts:** September 1
- **Usage fee tracking starts:** September 1 (same day)
- **Trial ends / Billing cycle starts:** September 15
- **First billing cycle:** September 15 - October 14
- **Second billing cycle:** October 15 - November 14
- ...and so on.

So while you won't be **charged** during the trial, the usage (like order count) is being tracked from day one. The actual charges begin on your first billing date after the trial ends.

This means your usage fee covers activity from the start of each billing cycle, and the cycle renews every 30 days from the date your trial ended.

Hope that clears things up! Let me know if you have any other questions about billing.
