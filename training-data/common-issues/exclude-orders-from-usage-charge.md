Q: Joy is counting orders from channels I don't use for loyalty. How do I fix this?

A: By default, Joy calculates usage charges based on **all orders** synced to your Shopify store, including orders from POS, marketplaces, and other sales channels. If you'd like to exclude orders from specific channels, here's what we need to do:

1. **Identify the channel**: Let us know which sales channel's orders you'd like to exclude (e.g., POS, Amazon, eBay, etc.).
2. **Confirm exclusion**: Please confirm that you're okay with those orders being excluded from the **entire loyalty program** as well (not just billing -- those orders won't earn points either).
3. **Tag your orders**: You'll need to consistently tag all orders from that channel with a specific tag. This helps us identify which orders to exclude.
4. **We'll submit the request**: Once the tagging is in place, we'll submit a request to our dev team to set up the exclusion.
5. **Follow-up**: We'll follow up with you once the dev team has processed the change.

Please share the details of which channel you'd like excluded, and we'll get started right away!

Escalate khi: After MC confirms and tags orders, submit request to dev team for processing.
