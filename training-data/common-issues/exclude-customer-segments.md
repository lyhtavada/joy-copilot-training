Q: How do I exclude specific customer segments from the loyalty program?
Q: Can I prevent wholesale customers from joining the loyalty program?
Q: I don't want certain customers (like VIPs or wholesale buyers) to participate in my loyalty program. How do I set that up?
Q: How can I block a group of customers from earning and redeeming points?
Q: Is there a way to exclude customers who frequently do chargebacks from the loyalty program?

A: Yes, you can absolutely exclude specific customer segments from your loyalty program! Here's how:

1. In your Joy admin, go to **Settings** > **Pre-launch**.
2. Look for the **Exclude segments** option.
3. Select the **Shopify Customer Segment** you want to exclude.
4. Save your changes.

Once excluded, all customers in that segment will be completely removed from the loyalty program -- they won't be able to earn points, redeem rewards, or see the loyalty widget on your store.

This is useful if you have wholesale customers, VIPs managed through a separate system, or customers with frequent chargebacks that you don't want participating in the program.

**Note:** Make sure you've already created the relevant customer segment in Shopify before setting up the exclusion in Joy.
