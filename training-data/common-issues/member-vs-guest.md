Q: What is the difference between a Member and a Guest in Joy Loyalty?
Q: Why are all my customers showing as Members? Some of them never created an account.
Q: How does Joy determine if someone is a Member or a Guest?
Q: I see Guest and Member labels in Joy. What do they mean?
Q: Why does Joy treat newsletter subscribers as Members?
A: Great question! The difference between **Member** and **Guest** in Joy Loyalty depends on which Customer Accounts setting your Shopify store uses. Let me break it down:

**If you're using New Customer Accounts (the default):**
- Shopify uses Single Sign-On (SSO), so any email submission — even just subscribing to your newsletter — creates a customer with "Enabled" status.
- Because of this, Joy treats **all** of these customers as Members. There's no Guest distinction, since Shopify considers them all as having accounts.

**If you're using Legacy (Classic) Customer Accounts:**
- A **Member** is someone who created an account with a password on your store.
- A **Guest** is someone who placed an order without creating an account.
- Joy can clearly distinguish between these two groups.

**Our recommendation:**
- If you only want to reward customers who actually created accounts (signed up with a password), we suggest switching to **Legacy Customer Accounts** in your Shopify settings.
- If you're happy rewarding all customers who have interacted with your store (including newsletter subscribers), you can keep the **New Customer Accounts** setting — just know that everyone will appear as a Member.
