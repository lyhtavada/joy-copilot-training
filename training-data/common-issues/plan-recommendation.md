A: Thank you for your interest in finding the right Joy plan for your store! For plan recommendations and pricing consultations, our **Sales team** is best equipped to help you. They can give you a personalized recommendation based on your store's needs and goals.

Here's how we can connect you with them:

**Option 1 - Book a demo call (Recommended):**
We can share a booking link so you can schedule a quick call with our Sales team. They'll walk you through the plans, answer all your questions, and help you pick the best fit.

**Option 2 - Sales follow-up:**
If you'd prefer not to hop on a call, no worries! We can pass your details to our Sales team and they'll follow up with you directly with a recommendation.

**For quick feature questions:**
If you have a specific feature in mind and just want to know which plan it belongs to, I can confirm that for you right away. Just let me know the feature you're looking for!

Escalate khi: Always forward to Sales team (#sales-cs-success) for plan/pricing advice. CS should not independently advise on plans or pricing. Escalate to Sales or PM if unsure about which plan a specific feature belongs to.
