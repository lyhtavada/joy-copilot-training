Q: I want to display the rewards widget on a specific page that's not the default. How?
Q: Can I show the Joy widget on a custom landing page or a non-standard page?
Q: How do I enable the loyalty widget on pages like FAQ, About Us, or custom pages?
A: Absolutely, you can show the Joy Loyalty widget on custom pages! Here's how to set it up:

**Steps to enable the widget on a custom page:**

1. **Share your store URL and the specific page URL** where you'd like the widget to appear — I'll need these to configure things on our end.
2. I'll go into the **Dev Zone** and enable the custom page option for your store.
3. Once enabled, a new **"Custom Page"** setting will appear under **Page Restriction** in your **Advanced Settings**.
4. Enter the URL(s) of the page(s) where you want the widget to show.
5. Save the settings, and the widget should now appear on those pages!

**Want to manage this yourself in the future?** Once I've enabled the custom page option, you can adjust it anytime:
- Go to **Joy Loyalty app** > **Onsite Content** > **Advanced Settings** > **Page Restriction**
- You'll see the **Custom Page** field where you can add or remove page URLs as needed.

Just send me your store URL and the page link, and I'll get this set up for you right away!
