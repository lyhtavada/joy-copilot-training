Q: How can I let customers type their birthday manually instead of picking from a calendar?
Q: I want to change the birthday input to a text field instead of a date picker. How do I do that?
Q: Customers are having trouble with the calendar selector for birthday. Can they just type it in?
Q: How do I switch from calendar selection to manual input for the birthday field in Joy?
A: You can enable manual birthday input in Joy, but it depends on the date format you choose. Here's how:

**Important:** Only certain date formats support manual input:
- **MM/DD/YYYY** (e.g., 03/15/1990) — supports manual input
- **DD/MM/YYYY** (e.g., 15/03/1990) — supports manual input
- **MM/DD** (e.g., 03/15) — calendar selection only
- **DD/MM** (e.g., 15/03) — calendar selection only

**Steps to set up manual birthday input:**

1. Go to **Joy app** > **Reward programs** > **Celebrate a birthday**
2. Look for the **Date format** setting
3. Change the date format to either **MM/DD/YYYY** or **DD/MM/YYYY**
4. Once you select one of these formats, a new option will appear — select **"Manual input"**
5. Save your changes

After this, customers will be able to type their birthday directly into a text field instead of having to use the calendar picker.

**Note:** If you prefer the shorter date formats (MM/DD or DD/MM), those will always use the calendar picker and cannot be switched to manual input.
