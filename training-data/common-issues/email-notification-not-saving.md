Q: I edited my email notification but the changes didn't save. What's going on?
Q: My email template changes keep disappearing after I save them. How do I fix this?
Q: I clicked save on my email notification edits but nothing changed. Why?
Q: The email notification content reverts to the old version after I save. Help!
A: We're sorry about this frustrating experience! This can occasionally happen due to a temporary technical glitch where the system doesn't register the save action properly, sometimes caused by network instability.

Here's what we recommend:

1. **Back up your content first**: Before making any more edits, copy your email notification content to an external file (like a text document or Google Doc) so you don't lose your work.
2. **Log out and log back in** to the app to refresh your session.
3. **Make your edits again** in the email notification template.
4. **Click "Save changes"** and then **wait 3-5 seconds** before reloading or navigating away from the page.
5. **Verify** that the changes are saved by refreshing the page.

This usually resolves the issue. If your changes still aren't saving after trying these steps, please let us know and include:
- Your store name/URL
- The name of the email template you're editing
- The approximate time you last tried saving

We'll escalate this to our technical team right away!

Escalate khi: Changes still fail to save after the merchant has tried logging out/in and waiting before reload -- escalate to the dev team with merchant info, template name, and timestamp.
