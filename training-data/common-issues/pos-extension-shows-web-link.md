Q: When I click "Add tile" to add the Joy extension on Shopify POS, it just shows a web link instead of the extension. How do I fix this?
Q: The Joy POS extension won't load on my device. It only shows a link to the web app instead.
Q: I'm trying to add the Joy loyalty extension to my POS but it doesn't load properly. It just displays a URL.
Q: My POS tile for Joy shows a website link instead of the actual extension interface. What's wrong?
A: If clicking "Add tile" to add the Joy extension on Shopify POS only shows a web app link instead of loading the extension, there are a few things to check:

**Step 1 - Verify your plan:**
Make sure your Joy plan includes POS integration. Not all plans support POS features. You can check this in your Joy admin under your plan details.

**Step 2 - Update your POS app and device:**
This issue often happens when the Shopify POS app or your device's operating system is outdated.
1. Go to your device's app store and update the **Shopify POS app** to the latest version.
2. Check for any available **operating system updates** on your device (iPad, iPhone, Android, etc.) and install them.
3. Restart the Shopify POS app after updating.

**Step 3 - Try adding the extension via Shopify Admin:**
If the extension still doesn't load on the POS device:
1. Log in to your **Shopify Admin** on a desktop browser.
2. Navigate to your **POS settings** and add the Joy extension from there.
3. The extension should then sync to your POS device automatically.

Escalate khi: The merchant is on the correct plan, POS app and device are fully updated, and the extension still fails to load after trying the admin-based setup.
