Q: Why am I being charged a usage fee on top of my monthly subscription?
Q: I see an extra "usage fee" on my bill. What is this charge for?
Q: My invoice shows a usage fee along with my monthly plan fee. Can you explain this?
Q: I didn't expect additional charges beyond my plan. Why is there a usage fee?
Q: How does the usage fee work? I was surprised to see it on my bill.
A: Great question! The usage fee is related to the **monthly order limit** included with your plan. Each plan comes with a set number of free orders per billing cycle, and if your store exceeds that limit, a small usage fee is applied for the additional orders.

Here's how it breaks down by plan:

- **Pro plan (without POS) - $24.99/month**: Includes **500 free orders**. After that, it's **$15 per 100 additional orders**.
- **Pro plan (with POS) - $44.99/month**: Includes **1,000 free orders**. After that, it's **$15 per 100 additional orders**.
- **Advanced plan**: Includes **2,000 free orders**. After that, it's **$10 per 100 additional orders**.

The usage fee is calculated based on the order count from your **previous billing cycle**.

To verify your order count:
1. You can check your order volume in your Shopify admin under **Orders**.
2. Compare it against your plan's free order limit for that billing period.

If you'd like, please share a screenshot of your invoice and we'll help you verify that the charges are correct!

Escalate khi: The usage fee amount does not match the expected calculation based on the merchant's plan and order count.
