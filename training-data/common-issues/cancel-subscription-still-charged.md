Q: I already cancelled my subscription but I was still charged. Why?
Q: I unsubscribed from the app but Shopify still billed me. Can you help?
Q: Why am I being charged after cancelling Joy Loyalty?
Q: I cancelled the plan but there's still a charge on my Shopify bill. What happened?
Q: I thought I cancelled but I see a new charge from Joy. Is this a mistake?
A: I totally understand the concern! Let me explain how Shopify billing works with app subscriptions:

1. **Shopify charges immediately when a subscription starts.** If you cancelled after the free trial period ended, the charge had already been activated for that billing cycle.
2. **If you cancelled mid-cycle**, the charge you see is for the current billing period that was already in progress — it's not a new charge after cancellation.

Here's what I'll do to help:
- First, I'll check your cancellation date and current billing status to confirm the timeline.
- If it turns out you didn't use the app at all after being charged, I can help submit a refund request on your behalf.

**Tip for the future:** To avoid unexpected charges, try to cancel before your trial period ends or before your next billing cycle begins. That way, no new charges will be triggered.

Let me look into your account now — could you share your store URL so I can check the details?

Escalate khi: MC insists the charge is incorrect after explanation and requests a refund that cannot be processed through normal channels.
