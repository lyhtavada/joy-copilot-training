Q: I see a warning that says "Unsupported feature: This app is not compatible with Markets." Should I be worried?
Q: Why does Shopify say this app is not compatible with Markets? Does it actually work?
Q: I'm getting an "Unsupported feature" warning about Markets when I install the app. Is the app broken?
Q: The app shows a Markets incompatibility warning. Will this cause problems with my store?
A: Don't worry -- this is just a cosmetic warning from Shopify and does **not** affect how the app actually works. Your app will continue to function perfectly fine!

Here's what's happening: Shopify displays this default warning for any app that hasn't yet updated to the very latest Markets and Catalogs API version (2025-04). It's purely informational and doesn't mean anything is broken.

You can safely:
- Continue installing the app
- Use all features as normal
- Ignore the warning message

This warning will automatically disappear once the app updates to the latest API version (typically within 7 days of the update being released).

If you notice any actual issues with your store or the app's functionality, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team!
