Q: Can I move the Joy widget launcher button to a different corner of the screen? It's overlapping with other apps.
Q: My customers can't see the loyalty widget because it's being covered by another button. How do I fix the placement?

A: If the Joy Loyalty widget button is in an awkward position -- either hidden behind other elements or blocking important buttons (like a chat widget) -- you can adjust its placement. Here's how:

**Step 1: Check the built-in position settings**
1. Go to **Joy > Onsite content > Widget** in your Joy admin.
2. Look for the **Position** or **Placement** settings.
3. You can typically choose which corner of the screen the widget appears in (bottom-left, bottom-right, etc.) and adjust the offset (distance from the edges).
4. Save and preview on your live store.

**Step 2: Fine-tune with CSS (if needed)**
If the built-in options don't give you enough control, you can use custom CSS to adjust the exact position:
1. In the widget settings, find the **Custom CSS** section.
2. Add CSS rules to adjust the widget's position. For example, you can modify the `bottom`, `right`, `left`, or `z-index` properties to move the button or change its layering relative to other elements.
3. Save and verify on your live store -- check both desktop and mobile views.

**Step 3: Tell us your preferred position**
If you're not sure how to make the changes yourself, let us know:
- Where you'd like the widget button to appear (e.g., "bottom-left corner, above the chat button").
- Whether the issue is on desktop, mobile, or both.
- A screenshot of the current layout so we can see the overlap.

We can then either guide you through the exact CSS needed or create a ticket for our technical team to handle the repositioning for you.

Escalate khi: Merchant cannot resolve the position conflict using built-in settings or basic CSS. Create a ticket for the technical team to review the store layout and implement the fix.
