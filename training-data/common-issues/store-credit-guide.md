Q: I've set up store credit through Joy, but how do my customers actually use it?
Q: Where can customers see their store credit balance?
Q: How does store credit work at checkout for customers?
Q: I set up the store credit flow with Joy and Shopify Flow, but my customers don't know how to redeem it. Can you help?
Q: How do I manage store credit for my customers in Shopify?

A: Great question! Store Credit is actually a **native Shopify feature** -- Joy's Shopify Flow trigger helps you automatically add credits to customer accounts, but the rest of the experience is managed through Shopify. Here's a full guide:

### 1. Enable Store Credit in Shopify
Make sure store credit is enabled in your Shopify admin:
- Go to **Shopify Settings** > **Customer accounts**.
- Ensure the new customer account experience is enabled (store credit requires this).

### 2. Managing Store Credit (Backend -- for Merchants)
You can view and adjust a customer's store credit balance in:
- **Shopify Admin** > **Customers** > select a customer > look for the **Store credit** section in their profile.
- From here, you can manually add or remove credits if needed.

### 3. Checking Store Credit (Frontend -- for Customers)
Customers can check their store credit balance by:
- Logging into their **customer account** on your store.
- Going to their **Profile** > **Payment methods** section.
- Their available store credit balance will be displayed there.

### 4. Using Store Credit at Checkout
At checkout, store credit works as a **supplementary payment method** (similar to how Shopee coins work):
- If the customer has store credit available, it will appear as a payment option at checkout.
- They can choose to apply their store credit toward the order total.
- If the store credit doesn't cover the full amount, they can pay the remaining balance with another payment method.

**Tip:** Make sure to communicate to your customers that they need to be logged in to their account to see and use their store credit!
