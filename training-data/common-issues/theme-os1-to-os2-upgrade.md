Q: Can you help me upgrade my Shopify theme from OS 1.0 to OS 2.0?
Q: My Joy loyalty widget isn't showing properly and I'm told I need OS 2.0. How do I upgrade?
Q: What's the difference between OS 1.0 and OS 2.0 themes, and why should I upgrade?
Q: I'm on an old Shopify theme and Joy features aren't displaying correctly. What should I do?
Q: How do I switch from Online Store 1.0 to 2.0 without losing my current theme?

A: We'd be happy to help you upgrade from OS 1.0 to OS 2.0! Here's what you need to know:

### Why Upgrade to OS 2.0?
OS 1.0 themes **do not support app blocks**, which means Joy's onsite content (like the loyalty widget, reward pages, and embedded elements) may not display properly. OS 2.0 is the current standard recommended by Shopify and fully supports app blocks for a much better experience.

### How the Upgrade Works
Don't worry -- **your current live theme will not be affected**. Here's our process:

1. **We duplicate your current theme** -- this creates an exact copy of your existing theme.
2. **We upgrade the duplicate** to OS 2.0 -- all changes are made on this copy, not your live store.
3. **You preview the upgraded theme** -- take your time to review everything and make sure it looks good.
4. **You decide when to publish** -- only when you're fully satisfied, you can publish the upgraded theme to make it live.

### What We Need From You
- **Confirm** that you're currently on an OS 1.0 theme and would like to proceed with the upgrade.
- **Grant theme access** so our team can work on the duplicate theme.

Once we have access, our team will handle the upgrade and let you know when it's ready for your review!

Escalate khi: If the theme has heavy custom code or third-party modifications that may complicate the upgrade, escalate to the technical support team for assessment.
