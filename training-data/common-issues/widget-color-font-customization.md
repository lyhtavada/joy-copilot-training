A: You can customize the Joy Loyalty widget's colors and fonts to match your store's theme. Here's how:

**Using Joy's built-in customization options:**
1. Go to **Joy > Onsite content > Widget** in your Joy admin.
2. Look for the appearance/style settings where you can adjust primary colors, background colors, text colors, and button styles.
3. Make your changes and preview them before saving.

**For more advanced customization using CSS:**
If the built-in options don't cover your specific needs (such as custom fonts or very precise color adjustments), you can use custom CSS:
1. In your Joy admin, go to the widget settings and look for the **Custom CSS** section.
2. Add your CSS rules to override the default styles. For example:
   - To change the font: target the widget's text elements with your preferred font-family.
   - To change colors: override the relevant color properties for backgrounds, text, and buttons.
3. Save your changes and check your live store to confirm everything looks correct.
