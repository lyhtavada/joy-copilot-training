Q: A merchant is asking how to use a feature. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle a "how to" question from a merchant?
Q: A merchant asks "How do I create a reward?" — what's the process?
A: How-to questions are the most common case type. Follow this process:

**Step 1: Receive the question**
Read the merchant's message carefully and identify which feature they're asking about.

**Step 2: Check knowledge base**
- Is there an existing help article on help.joy.so?
- Is the documentation clear and up-to-date?

**Step 3: Provide answer**
- Link to the relevant help article.
- Include step-by-step instructions with navigation paths (e.g., "Go to Reward Programs > Earning Programs").
- Add screenshots if helpful.

**Step 4: Follow up**
- Ask "Did this help?" or "Is there anything else I can help with?"
- Offer additional assistance if needed.

**Step 5: Close (optional)**
- Mark as resolved when the merchant confirms.

**When to escalate:**
- If the question is about advanced technical configuration → create a Trello card for TS.
- If the merchant asks about a feature that doesn't exist → forward to PM via Slack.
- If the question reveals a bug → switch to the Bug Report process.
