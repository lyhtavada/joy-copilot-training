Q: What is the standard live chat support process?
Q: What steps should I follow when handling a live chat conversation?
Q: How do I properly handle a customer chat from start to finish?
A: Follow this 8-step live chat process for every conversation to ensure a professional and consistent experience:

**Step 1: Greeting**
Politely greet the customer and introduce yourself.
Example: "Hi [Customer's Name], this is [Your Name] from Avada Support. Thanks for reaching out — I'm happy to assist you today!"

**Step 2: Show Empathy**
Acknowledge the customer's situation and show understanding.
Example: "I totally understand how frustrating this must be. Let's work together to get this sorted out for you."

**Step 3: Probing (Very Important)**
Ask specific, open-ended questions to understand the root issue.
Example: "Could you please share a bit more details about the issue? For example, when did it happen and on which page?"

**Step 4: Set Expectation**
Inform the customer about next steps and estimated handling time.
Example: "I'll check this for you right away. It might take about 2–3 minutes. Thanks for your patience!"

**Step 5: Troubleshoot**
Investigate, analyze, and propose the best solution. Guide the customer clearly if their cooperation is needed. Refer to the case handling process and escalation guidelines.

**Step 6: Update Result & Follow Up**
Inform the customer of the result, whether resolved or still in progress.
Example: "I've just fixed the issue for you! Could you please help me double-check if everything works fine now?"

**Step 7: Achieve More**
After resolving the main issue, proactively offer additional help or suggest useful features.
Example: "Is there anything else I can assist you with today? By the way, I noticed you haven't activated [Feature X] yet — it could really help boost your [goal]. Would you like me to show you quickly?"

**Step 8: Farewell & Ask for Review (Mandatory)**
Thank the customer and ask for a review if they are satisfied. This is a mandatory step.
Example: "Thank you so much for your time today! If you're happy with the support, we would truly appreciate it if you could leave us a quick review — it really helps our team continue improving."

**Important reminders:**
- Always maintain a friendly, proactive, and professional tone.
- Never leave the customer waiting without an update.
- Follow this flow for every case, even small ones, to create a consistent and trustworthy customer experience.

Q: Why is asking for a review mandatory in the live chat flow?
Q: Do I always need to ask the customer for a review?
A: Yes, asking for a review is a mandatory step in the live chat flow. Positive reviews encourage other merchants to use the app, which increases installs. Customer feedback also helps the team understand the product's strengths and weaknesses for improvement. Always ask for a review at the end of the conversation when the customer is satisfied, and include the review link if available.

Q: What is probing and why is it important in live chat?
Q: How should I ask questions to understand the customer's issue?
A: Probing is the skill of asking targeted questions to truly understand the customer's problem. It is one of the most important steps in live chat support. Use specific, open-ended questions to uncover the root cause. For example: "Could you please share more details about the issue? When did it happen and on which page?" Good probing helps you resolve issues faster and more accurately, avoiding back-and-forth that frustrates the customer.

Q: What should I do after resolving the customer's main issue in live chat?
Q: Should I just close the chat after fixing the problem?
A: No, don't close immediately. After resolving the main issue, move to the "Achieve More" step — proactively ask if they need help with anything else, and suggest useful features they haven't activated yet. Then proceed to the Farewell step where you thank them and ask for a review. This approach maximizes each interaction's value and improves customer satisfaction.
