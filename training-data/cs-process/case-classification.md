Q: How should I classify a merchant's support request?
Q: What are the different types of support cases?
Q: How do I know what type of issue a merchant is reporting?
A: When a merchant reaches out, classify their request into one of these categories:

| Case Type | Examples | Handler |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **How-to Questions** | "How do I create a reward?", "Where can I see customer points?" | CS Agent |
| **Feature Requests** | "Can you add tier expiration?", "Integration with [app]?" | CS Agent → PM |
| **Bug/Issue Reports** | "Points not credited", "Widget not displaying" | CS → TS → Dev |
| **Billing & Subscription** | "I was charged but didn't use the app", "How do I upgrade?" | CS Agent (CS Leader for refunds) |
| **Complaints** | "Your app is terrible!", "I've been waiting for days" | CS Agent → CS Leader |
| **Pre-sales Questions** | "Does your app do X?", "How much does it cost?" | CS Agent |
| **Integration Questions** | "Can this work with [App X]?", "How do I connect Klaviyo?" | CS (basic) → TS (complex) |
| **Discount Requests** | "Can I get a discount on the plan?" | CS Agent → CS Leader/Sales |
| **Demo Requests** | "Can you show me how this works?" | CS Agent (schedule) |

First determine if the merchant has a **question** or a **problem**, then classify into the specific case type to follow the right process.
