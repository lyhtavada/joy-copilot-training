Q: A merchant requests a new feature. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle feature requests?
Q: A merchant asks "Can you add tier expiration?" — what's the process?
A: Feature requests should be documented and forwarded to the Product team. Follow this process:

**Step 1: Understand the need**
- Why do they need this feature?
- What's their specific use case?
- Is there a workaround with existing features?

**Step 2: Check existing features**
- Does this feature already exist (maybe under a different name)?
- Can current features solve their problem?
- If YES → guide the merchant to the existing solution.
- If NO → proceed to document the request.

**Step 3: Document the request**
Include:
- Merchant info (store URL, plan)
- Detailed use case
- Business impact
- Number of similar requests (if known)

**Step 4: Submit to Product team**
- Add to the feature request Trello board.
- Tag PM in Slack if needed.

**Step 5: Set merchant expectations**
- "We've forwarded your request to our Product team."
- "We don't have a timeline yet, but we'll update you if it gets prioritized."
- Never promise a feature will be built or give a specific date.

**Step 6: Follow up monthly**
- Check status with PM.
- Update the merchant if there's any movement.

**When to escalate to PM directly:**
- The same request comes from 5+ merchants.
- It's from a VIP merchant.
- The request aligns with the known product roadmap.
- There's an urgent business need.
