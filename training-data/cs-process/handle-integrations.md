Q: A merchant asks about integrating with another app. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle integration questions?
Q: A merchant asks "How do I connect with Klaviyo?" — what's the process?
Q: A merchant asks about custom theme integration. What do I do?
A: Integration questions are handled based on complexity:

**Step 1: Identify integration type**

- **Native integration** (built by Joy — e.g., Klaviyo, Judge.me, Omnisend):
  → CS provides the setup guide directly from help.joy.so.

- **Common third-party app** (known compatible apps):
  → CS provides the standard answer and links to documentation.

- **Custom/uncommon integration** (app we don't have a guide for):
  → Escalate to TS for assessment via Trello card.

- **Theme customization** (custom code, Hydrogen, headless):
  → Escalate to TS via Trello card.

**Step 2: Provide information**
- Explain how the integration works.
- Share setup instructions with step-by-step navigation.
- Note any limitations or plan requirements.

**Step 3: Offer hands-on support**
- Guide them through setup if needed.
- Test together to confirm the integration works.
