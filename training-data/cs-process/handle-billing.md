Q: A merchant has a billing question. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle refund requests?
Q: A merchant says "I was charged but didn't use the app" — what's the process?
Q: A merchant wants to cancel their subscription. What do I do?
A: Billing issues are handled differently based on the type:

**General inquiry** (plan comparison, how to upgrade):
→ CS handles directly. Explain plan features and guide the merchant through the upgrade process in their Shopify admin.

**Charge confusion** (why charged, unexpected amount):
→ CS explains the charge. Check the merchant's charge history, review plan usage, and provide invoice details.

**Refund request:**
→ Escalate to CS Leader. Gather information first: charge history, plan usage, subscription status, and the merchant's concern.

**Dispute/chargeback:**
→ Immediately escalate to CS Leader with full context.

**Cancellation request:**
→ CS handles. Understand why they want to cancel. If possible, address their concerns. Guide them through the cancellation process if they proceed.

**Information to gather for billing issues:**
- Charge history
- Current plan and usage
- Subscription status
- Merchant's specific concern
