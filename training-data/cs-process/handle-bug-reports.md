Q: A merchant reports a bug. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle an issue report from a merchant?
Q: A merchant says "points not being credited" — what's the process?
Q: When should I escalate a bug to the technical team?
A: Bug/issue reports require careful triage before escalation. Follow this process:

**Step 1: Receive the report**
Read the merchant's description carefully. Common examples: "Points not being credited", "Widget not displaying", "Email notifications not sending", "App crashed when I clicked X".

**Step 2: Initial triage**
Ask clarifying questions if needed:
- When did this start happening?
- Is it affecting all customers or specific ones?
- Did they change any settings recently?

**Step 3: Basic troubleshooting**
- Check merchant's settings in their store.
- Verify the app is installed correctly.
- Check if the relevant program/feature is active.
- Review recent changes the merchant made.
- Test on a test store if possible.

**Step 4: Can you resolve it?**
- **YES (configuration issue):** Guide the merchant to fix it, verify the fix works, close the ticket.
- **NO (likely technical bug):** Proceed to Step 5.

**Step 5: Gather evidence**
Collect before escalating:
- Screenshots and/or screen recording
- Exact steps to reproduce the issue
- Console errors (if the merchant can provide)
- Store URL
- Affected features and customer emails/order numbers

**Step 6: Assess priority**
Use the priority matrix (P0-P3) to determine urgency.

**Step 7: Escalate**
Create a Trello card with all gathered evidence. For P0 Critical issues, also notify via Slack immediately.

**Step 8: Update the merchant**
- Inform them: "I've escalated this to our technical team."
- Set expectations on timeline based on priority.
- Provide a ticket reference.

**Conditions to escalate:**
- You've confirmed it's not a merchant configuration issue.
- The bug is clear with reproducible steps.
- You have complete evidence (screenshots, video, store URL).
- You've assessed the priority level.
