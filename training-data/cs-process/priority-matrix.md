A: Use this priority matrix to assess urgency:

**Priority Levels:**

| **P0 - Critical** | App down, data loss, security issue, affects all merchants or financial loss | App won't load, all points deleted, payment broken, buyers can't checkout | Immediate (< 1 hour) | 4-24 hours |
| **P1 - High** | Core feature broken, affects merchant business | Rewards can't be redeemed, reviews not displaying | 2-4 hours | 1-5 days |
| **P2 - Medium** | Minor feature issue, workaround available | Email delay, minor display issue | 4-24 hours | 1-2 weeks |
| **P3 - Low** | Cosmetic issue, enhancement request | Color alignment, text typo, minor UI inconsistency | 1-2 days | Backlog |

**SLA by Ticket Type:**
