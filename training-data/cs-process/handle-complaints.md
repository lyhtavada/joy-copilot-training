A: Complaints require fast, empathetic responses. SLA: respond within 2 hours. Follow this process:

**Step 1: Respond quickly**
Acknowledge immediately. Don't leave an angry merchant waiting.

**Step 2: Stay professional**
Don't take it personally. Empathize genuinely with their frustration.

**Step 3: Understand root cause**
- What actually went wrong?
- Is it something we can fix?
- Is it our fault or a misunderstanding?

**Step 4: Take ownership**
Apologize for their experience, even if the issue isn't directly our fault. Commit to finding a resolution.

**Step 5: Provide a solution**
- Offer a specific action plan.
- Give a realistic timeline.
- Offer compensation if appropriate (e.g., extended trial, plan discount).

**Step 6: Follow through**
Do exactly what you promised. Update proactively. Verify the merchant is satisfied.

**Step 7: Document and learn**
Share with the team. Update processes if this could be prevented in the future.

**When to escalate to CS Leader (via Slack):**
- After 2 attempts, the merchant is still angry.
- Merchant threatens legal action.
- Merchant threatens a public negative review.
- Issue involves refund or compensation.
- VIP merchant complaint.
