Q: A merchant asks for a discount on the plan. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle discount or pricing negotiation requests?
Q: A merchant says "Can I get a discount to upgrade?" — what's the process?
A: Discount requests depend on whether there's an active promotion.

**Scenario 1: There IS an active promotion**

1. Check current promotions and announcements.
2. Verify merchant eligibility (new vs existing, plan level, exclusions).
3. Share promotion details and how to claim.
4. No escalation needed — CS handles completely.

**Scenario 2: There is NO active promotion**

1. Confirm no active promotion exists (check with team if unsure).
2. Acknowledge the request and set expectations: "Let me check with our team."
3. Escalate to the appropriate channel:
   - Joy Loyalty → Slack #sales-cs-success, tag @sales-manager
4. Wait for decision (24-48 hours).
5. Communicate the decision to the merchant:
   - Approved → provide discount details.
   - Declined → offer alternatives (e.g., suggest starting with Free plan, highlight upcoming promotions).
