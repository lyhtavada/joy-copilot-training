Q: A customer is asking for my personal information (social media, phone number). What should I do?
Q: How do I handle a merchant requesting personal details?
A: Never share personal information. Follow this escalation approach:

**1. Politely decline and redirect to app support:**
"Sorry, I can't share personal information. If you need help with the app, I'll be happy to assist."

**2. If they ask again, be firm:**
"As I mentioned, I cannot share personal information. Please keep the conversation related to the app."
"I can only respond to questions related to the app. Let's please keep the conversation focused on that."

**3. If they persist, end the conversation:**
"I can only support with the app. If you need help with the app later, please feel free to reach out again."
Then close the chat.

Q: A customer is using sexually harassing or seriously offensive language toward me. What should I do?
Q: How do I handle harassment or abusive language from a merchant?
A: This process applies when the customer is harassing or personally insulting the CS agent and there is no actual app/service issue. Follow these steps:

**1. Remind them to be respectful:**
"Your message is inappropriate. Please keep the conversation respectful so I can assist you."

**2. Warn if it continues:**
"This kind of language is not acceptable. If it continues, I will need to end this conversation."

**3. End and report:**
"I'm ending this chat due to repeated inappropriate language. If you need help with the app in the future, please contact us respectfully."

**Note:** In cases of sexual harassment, a female CS agent may transfer the case to a male colleague as a temporary measure. However, no one is required to continue supporting a harassing customer — always follow the warn → end chat flow if behavior is serious.

Q: A customer is spamming or repeatedly asking the same question. How should I handle the response pace?
Q: Do I need to reply immediately when a customer is spamming?
A: No, you do not need to reply immediately to spam or repeated personal questions. You can:

- **Slow down your response by 2–3 minutes** to reduce the conversation pace. This subtly signals that these are not priority questions.
- Reply with a short, consistent script — no need to change your reasoning each time.
- After 1–2 slow reminders, if they still persist → **warn and end the chat**.

Q: When can I block a customer after warnings, and when should I escalate?
Q: What's the difference between handling a dev store vs a real store for blocking?
A: It depends on whether it's a dev store or a real store:

**Dev store** (check CRM — cannot write reviews, no retention value):
- CS has the authority to **block immediately** after warning.
- Note the reason for blocking in the chat.
- Inform your leader for awareness.

**Real store** (can write reviews):
- CS should **report to the CS Leader** and let them decide the next steps.
- Do not block on your own — escalate first.

Q: What are the general principles for handling sensitive situations?
Q: What rules should I always follow when dealing with difficult or inappropriate customers?
A: Follow these core principles:

1. **Never reveal personal information** — keep all interactions professional and app-focused.
2. **Stay professional** — do not argue, do not respond to insults with insults.
3. **Give 2–3 reminders** → then warn and end the chat if behavior continues.
4. **When customers spam** → slow down your replies to reduce the conversation pace.
5. **Dev stores** → CS can block on their own after warning.
6. **Real stores** → always report to the CS Leader for further handling.
