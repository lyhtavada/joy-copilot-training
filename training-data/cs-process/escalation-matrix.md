|-----------|------------|------|-----|
| Technical bug (after CS troubleshooting) | TS | Immediately | Trello card |
| Cannot reproduce bug | TS | Immediately | Trello card |
| Critical bug (P0) | PM + TS Leader | Immediately | Slack with context |
| Refund request | CS Leader | Immediately | Slack or Trello card |
| Angry merchant (after 2 attempts) | CS Leader | Immediately | Slack or Trello card |
| VIP merchant (any issue) | CS Leader | FYI immediately | Slack with context |
| Feature request (5+ merchants) | PM | Weekly batch | Slack with context |
| Design/UX confusion (multiple cases) | PM | Weekly batch | Slack with context |
| Complex custom integration | PM | After initial assessment | Slack with context |
| Security concern | CS Leader + PM | Immediately | Slack + #urgent |
| Data loss issue | CS Leader + PM | Immediately | Slack + #urgent |

**Before escalating a bug, make sure you have:**

- Clear steps to reproduce.
- Complete evidence (screenshots, video, store URL).
- Priority assessment (P0/P1/P2/P3).
